A：prices are determined by consumers
B：supply and demand are allowed to operate freely
C：economic regulations are not enforced
D：the economy is growing
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于词义推断题。根据第4段第1句的内容可知：美国人相信一旦经济力量unfettered，供求关系就决定商品和服务的价格。由生活常识可知，只有经济力量放开时，商品和服务的价格才能由供求关系来决定。此外，下一段第1句话又指出：然而，自由经营的企业也有局限。由上下文可知，unfettered应该是limits的反义词，即“自由的，不受限制的”。这样，只有选项B的意思符合句意。

  Passage Two
       Competitors complain that Microsoft's recent settlement of their antitrust case with the federal government will do little to protect them or consumers from the software giant's monopoly power. But they hold out hope that state attorney generals could make the deal more restrictive.  "My guess is that all Bill Gates could do was to suppress a big grin when he held his press conference this morning," said Mitchell Kertzman, chief executive of Liberate Technologies, a rival provider of software for interactive TV.  "This settlement doesn't come close to matching the scope of the violations of antitrust law that Microsoft has been convicted of," he added. "It was an inexplicably bad deal for the government. "
     Microsoft and the Justice Department presented the settlement to a federal judge this Friday, saying it would end the antitrust case in a way that would help the sagging economy. U. S.  District Judge Colleen Kollar Kotelly agreed to review it and gave the 18 states involved in the case until Tuesday to decide whether to accept the plan.
     Several competitors called on the state attorney generals to insist on making changes to the settlement. Sun Microsystems' general counsel, Michael Morris, said the Justice Department was walking away from a case they had already won. " Paul T. Cappuccio, the general counsel for AOL Time Warner, said the settlement "does too little to promote competition and protect consumers, and can too easily be evaded by a determined monopolist like Microsoft. "
The state attorney generals had been pressing for stiffer penalties, but on Friday, several said some progress had been made. Among the key elements of the settlement, Microsoft would have to:
  Help rivals make products compatible with the Windows operating system, which runs 91% of the world's computers.
  Stop using exclusive deals with computer sellers to put competitors at a disadvantage.
  Let three in-house, independent experts monitor its compliance.
    "We're quite disappointed. We believe that there are a lot of issues that haven't been addressed," said Michael Mace, chief officer of handheld computer maker Palm, "which makes an operating system that competes with one from Microsoft." Several tech executives said the settlement was too focused on restricting Microsoft's Windows monopoly, and not its broader business practices and non-PC initiatives.
"This is a reward, not a remedy. It fails to terminate the illegal monopoly and fails to unfetter the market from anticompetitive conduct," said Kelly Jo MacArthur, general counsel for Real Networks, which makes music and video software threatened by Windows Media Player. "This agreement allows a declared illegal monopolist to determine, at its sole discretion, what goes into the monopoly operating system in the future," she added.
 

1. We can infer from the text that the main issue behind Microsoft’s antitrust case is the need ____ .
A：to boost a sagging economy
B：to limit the reach of Microsoft's Windows operating system
C：to prevent Microsoft from monopolizing the computer industry
D：for Microsoft to assist its competitors in making products compatible with Windows
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。文章第1段第1句指出：竞争对手抱怨微软最近和联邦政府达成的反托拉斯案件的协议对保护他们和消费者免受这个软件巨人的垄断控制起不了什么作用。倒数第2段最后一句又补充道：数位技术管理人员说这个协议只着重于限制微软视窗的垄断，而没有考虑到更广泛的经营活动以及非个人计算机的创新业务。由此可知，选项 C正确。

2. The comment from Michael Morris (Para.3) implies that the Justice Department ______ .
A：had just wrapped up a successful case
B：missed a chance to more stringently regulate Microsoft
C：was leaving most of the work to the state attorney generals involved
D：had failed in their mission to protect business competition.
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词Michael Morris，Justice Department出现在第3段第2句：……迈克尔•莫里斯说，司法部“正从已经获得胜利的案件中脱身”。再结合其上下文分析可知，司法部错过了一个更加严格地约束微软的好机会。因此，选项B正确。

3. The fourth paragraph suggests that most of the state attorney generals _______ .
A：were under pressure from Microsoft's competitors to demand changes in the settlement
B：felt that the settlement was at least partially successful
C：felt the penalties against Microsoft were too harsh
D：believed that the settlement was a sign of progress for the computer industry
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。第4段第1句指出：国家首席检察官们一直在竭力要求实行更加严厉的处罚，而星期五，数位首席检察官说已经取得了进展。由此可知，他们认为这一案子至少已经取得了部分的成功，故选项B正确。

4. What provision of the settlement is meant to ensure its enforcement?
A：The review of a federal judge.
B：The review and approval by 18 state attorney generals.
C：The monitoring by independent experts installed at Microsoft.
D：The watchful eyes of Microsoft's numerous competitors.
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。协议的主要内容在第5、6、7段：帮助对手生产与世界上91%的计算机使用的视窗操作系统兼容的产品；停止与计算机销售商达成排他性的协议而使竞争对手处于不利的地位；允许三位进驻公司的独立专家监督协议的遵守情况。显然，最后一条是本题的答案，即选项C。

5. This text is mainly about _______ .
A：the role of the federal government in managing disputes in technology industry
B：Microsoft's settlement of the antitrust case with the federal government
C：Microsoft's monopoly over the computer industry
D：competitors' responses to Microsoft's antitrust settlement
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于主旨思想题。文章第1段第1句就指出“竞争对手对微软最近和联邦苻达成的反托拉斯案件的协议有怨言”。接下来的几段详细介绍了有关协议及其竞争对手对拘意见和反应。由此可见，本文重点讲述了竞争对手们对微软反托拉斯案件达成的协议的立，即选项D正确。

 Passage Three
  What do the consumers really want? That's a question market researchers would love to answer. But since people don't always say what they think, marketers would need direct access to consumers' thoughts to get the truth.
     Now, in a way, that is possible. At the "Mind of the Market" laboratory at Harvard Business School, researchers are looking inside shoppers' skulls to develop more effective advertisements and marketing pitches. Using imaging techniques that measure the blood flow to various parts of the brain, the Harvard team hopes to predict how consumers will react to particular products and to discover the most effective ways to present information. Stephen Kosslyn, a professor of psychology at Harvard, and Business School professor Cerald Zaltman, oversee the lab. The goal is not to manipulate people's preference," says Kosslyn, "just to speak to their actual desires."  The group's finding, though still preliminary, could radically change how firms develop and market new products.
The Harvard group use position emission topography (PET) scans to monitor the brain activity. These PET scans, along with other non-invasive imaging techniques, enable researchers to see which parts of the brain are active during specific tasks (such as remembering a word).  Correlations have been found between blood flow to specific areas and future behavior. Because of this, Harvard researchers believe the scans can also predict future purchasing patterns. According to an unpublished paper the group produced, "It's possible to use these techniques to predict not only whether people will remember and have specific emotional reactions to certain materials, but also whether they will be inclined to want those materials months later."
The Harvard group is now moving into the next stage of experiments. They will explore how people remember advertisements as part of an effort to predict how they will react to a product after having seen an ad. The researchers believe that once key areas of the brain identified, scans on about two dozen volunteers will be enough to draw conclusions about the reactions of specific segments of the population. Large corporations-including Coca Cola, Eastman Kodak, General Motors, and Hallmark-have already signed up to fund further investigations.
For their financial support, these firms gain access to the experiments but cannot control them. If Kosslyn and Zaltman and their team really can read the mind of the market, the consumers may find it even harder to get those advertising jingles out of their heads.
   

1. Which of the following statements can be the best title for this passage?
A：Reading the Mind of the Market
B：Controlling the Consumers' Preference
C：Improving the Styles of Advertising
D：Finding Out the Way to Predict
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于主旨思想题。参照文章第2段中“Mind of the Market”laboratory和尾段的If Kosslyn and Zaltman and their team really can read the mind of the market可以推断出选项A正确答案。

2. Why do the Harvard researchers use scientific technology in the experiments?
A：Because they don't believe the surveys done by the marketers can lead to the truth.
B：Because they are asked by the marketers to find a direct way to read the consumers' thoughts.
C：Because they want to find out how the ads influence people's brain activity, emotional responses, etc.
D：Because they expect that their experiments can basically alter the marketing strategies of product.
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推理题。文中第2段第4句提及该实验的目的不是操纵人们的喜，而是要对顾客的实际需求做出反应。由此判断，选项C为正确答案。

3. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?
A：Sometimes people will conceal what they think when being questioned by the market researchers.
B：Stephen Kosslyn and Gerald Zaltman overlook the experiments and criticize the purpose of the study.
C：Harvard researchers have found the corresponding relations between people's brain and behavior.
D：There are many large organizations endorsing and financing the Harvard group's further investigation.
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于是非判断题。文中第2段第4句话提及“oversee”，而不是选项B中的 overlook”，由此判断，选项B正确。

4. What does “to speak to“ in the fifth sentence of the second paragraph mean?
A：to talk to
B：to say to
C：to communicate to
D：to respond to
正确答案：D
答案为D．属于词义推断题。提出的关键词speak to出现在第2段第4句话：“The goal not to manipulate people's preference,”says Kosslyn,“just to speak to their actual desires.”本句意思为，实验的目的不是操纵人们的喜好，而是要对顾客的实际需求做出反应。故选项D正确答案。

5. The last sentence of this passage implies that _______.
A：if the experiments' results can be applied to the practice, the customers will be likely to buy things according to the ads
B：if the Harvard group can succeed in finishing the research they will use it in attracting more and more consumers into the market
C：the financial supporting corporations such as Coca Cola, General Motors can employ the experiments in their own marketing
D：the consumers may discover that those ads will always annoy them by jingling out of their heads and cause them headaches
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推理题。文中第4段首句提到，哈佛的研究团队正在进行新一轮试验，即：研究人们如何记住产品广告，并借此来预测人们看到一个广告后，对该产品反如何。由此推理，选项A正确。

 Passage Two
  For centuries in Spain and Latin America, heading home for lunch and a snooze with the family was something like a national right, but with global capitalism standardizing work hours, this idyllic habit is fast becoming an endangered pleasure.  Ironically, all this is happening just as researchers are beginning to note the health benefits of the mid-afternoon nap.
According to a nationwide survey, less than 25 percent of Spaniards still enjoy siestas. And like Spain, much of Latin America has adopted Americanized work schedules, too, with shortened lunch time and more rigid work hours.  Last year the Mexican government passed a law limiting lunch breaks to one hour and requiring its employees to work their eight-hour shift between 7 a. m.  and 6 p. m. Before the mandate, workers would break up the shift-going home midday for a long break with the family and returning to work until about 90r 10 p. m. The idea of siesta is changing in Greece, Italy and Portugal, too, as they rush to join their more "industrious" counterparts in the global market.
Most Americans I know covet sleep, but the idea of taking a nap mid-afternoon equates with laziness, unemployment and general sneakiness. Yet according to a National Sleep Survey poll, 65 percent of adults do not get enough sleep. Numerous scientific studies document the benefits of nap taking, including one I997 study on the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation in the journal Internal Medicine. The researchers found that fatigue harms not only marital and social relations but worker productivity.
According to Mark Rosekind, a former NASA scientist and founder of Alertness Solutions in Cupertino, Calif.,  which educates busine96es about the advantages of sanctioning naps,  we're biologically programmed to get sleepy between 3 and 5 p.m. and 3 and 5 a.m. Our internal timekeeper - called the circadian clock-operates on a 24-hour rotation and every 12 hours there's a dip.  In accordance with these natural sleep rhythms, Rosekind recommends that naps be either for 40 minutes or for two hours. Latin American countries, asserts Rosekind, have had it right all along. They've been in sync with their clocks; we haven't.
Since most of the world is sleep-deprived, getting well under the recommended eight hours a night( adults get an average of 6.5 hours nightly) , we usually operate on a kind of idle midday.  Naps are even more useful now that most of us forfeit sleep because of insane work schedules, longer commute times and stress. In a study published last April, Brazilian medical researchers noted that blood pressure and arterial blood pressure dropped during a siesta.

1. In the second sentence of Paragraph l, “all this“ refers to ______.
A：the habit of napping
B：the standardizing of work hours
C：the decline of the siesta tradition
D：the growth of global capitalism
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于指代关系题。分析上下文可知，all this指的是上文中的this idyllic habit is fast becoming an endangered pleasure。因此，选项C正确。

2. We can infer from the second paragraph that Mexican workers now ______ .
A：work fewer hours than in the past
B：get home from work much later than in the past
C：work more reasonable hours than in the past
D：finish the workday earlier than in the past
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词Mexican workers出现在本段第3、4句：去年墨西哥政府通过一条法律，把午休时间缩短为1小时，并要求员工从上午7点到下午6点之间完成8小时的工作。此前，工人们中午暂时停止工作，回家同家人一起休息很长一段时间，然后再回去工作直到晚上九、十点钟左右。由此不难推出选项D项正确。

3. The word “covet“ in Paragraph 3 most likely means _______ .
A：need
B：desire
C：lack
D：value
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于词义推断题。根据第3段第1句可知：我认识的大多数美国人都 covet sleep，但是睡午觉的想法就等同于懒惰、失业以及总要偷偷摸摸。关联词but的使用表明后面的内容与前文意思的转折。由此可知，大多数美国人都渴望睡眠，故正确答案为 B项。

4. The author suggests that most Americans feel that _______ .
A：Spanish culture is inefficient
B：nap-taking will put their jobs at risk
C：nap-taking is a sign of laziness
D：they get plenty of sleep
正确答案：A

答案为D，属于主旨思想题。从文章内容来看，不但涉及了午睡的种种好处，而且还讲述了有关的发展历史和传统，因此能概括出这两方面内容的只有选项D。

 Passage Three
  There are a number of formats for reporting research, such as articles to appear in journals, reports addressed to funding agencies, theses or dissertations as part of the requirements for university degrees, and papers to be presented at conferences. These formats differ from one another mostly in their purposes and the audiences whom they address. We will now briefly describe them.
The journal article is a way of reporting research for professional journals or edited collections. The research is reporting in a brief, yet informative way, focusing mostly on the main features of the research such as the purpose, review of the literature ( often referred to as " background" ) , procedures used for carrying out the research accompanied by tables, charts, and graphs, and interpretations of the results (often referred to as discussion) .
The content and emphasis of the journal article will vary according to the intended readers (researchers or practitioners) and it is important for the researchers to be aware of the background and interest of the readers of the journal. Articles intended to be read by practitioners will emphasize the practical implications and recommendations of the research, while articles intended to be read by researchers will describe in detail the method used to collect data, the construction of data collection procedures, and the techniques used for analyzing the data. It is important for the novice researchers to be aware of the fact that articles submitted to journals go through a process of evaluation by experts who make a judgment and recommend whether they should be published or not.
The thesis or dissertation is a format for reporting research which graduate students write as part of fulfilling the requirements for an advanced academic degree. The student is expected to describe in great detail all the phases of the research so it can be examined and evaluated carefully by the reader. Thus the thesis or dissertation includes the purpose and significance of the study, the rationale, a thorough review of the literature, detailed information as to the research tools and the procedures involved in their development, a description of data analysis and the results, and an interpretation of the results in the form of conclusions, implications, and recommendation. This detailed description of the process of the research is needed to provide the professors with an indication of the student's ability to carry out research.
The conference paper is a way of reporting research at conferences, seminars and colloquia.  At such meetings research papers are usually presented orally. They are similar to the research article since research is reported in a concise, yet informative way, focusing on the most essential elements of the research. Handouts and transparencies can also accompany the presentations. As with the research article, here too, the audience present at the meeting, and whether they are researchers or practitioners.

1. The best title for this passage could be _______ .
A：Types of Research Reports
B：Types of Journal Articles
C：Writing of Research Reports

5. How can a professor evaluate a student’s capability of implementing the research?
A：By concentrating on the main factors like the purpose, background, procedures and discussion.
B：By emphasizing the practical implications and recommendations of the research.
C：By focusing on the detailed description of the process of the research such as the tools, procedures, process of data analysis, results, conclusions, etc.

 Passage Two
  The use of chemicals in almost all areas of life has become a commonplace phenomenon. There is growing evidence, however, that chemicals in the environment, including pesticides, may contribute to some illnesses. While studies are still being conducted, preliminary conclusions point to the verdict that such chemicals are indeed negatively impacting those humans to whom they are exposed.
Children are especially vulnerable to toxic substances. Pound for pound, they eat, drink and breathe more than adults, all of which exposes them more heavily to those chemicals to which most individuals encounter on a daily basis. Furthermore, their bodies are still in developing stages, exacerbating the negative effects of those chemicals which negatively impact them.
Of 50 types of pesticides commonly used in American schools, a study conducted by the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides found that many caused negative reactions in laboratory animals. Such negative effects included kidney and liver damage, cancer and neurological and reproductive problems.
These implications of these findings are far-reaching. Given the variety of harmful effects attributed to those pesticides tested, one must pause and consider whether it is wise to continue their use in the nation's schools, where children will be constantly exposed to them. Activists have lobbied for the elimination of such use with a degree of success, and recent findings, if supported by further analysis and confirmation, may help further the cause. A long term solution or alternative, however, remains elusive.
In the short run, however, there may be some measures that can be taken to mitigate the harmful effects of dangerous pesticides. The American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs concluded in a 1997 report that given the "particular uncertainty...regarding the long-term health effects of low-dose pesticide exposures" , it is " prudent" for adults and children to limit their exposure and to " consider the use of the least toxic chemical pesticides or non-chemical alternatives".
 

1. The citing of dangerous effects of pesticides on laboratory animals in Paragraph 3 is used to suggest that _______ .
A：scientists are also concerned with the effects of pesticides on animals
B：cancer is the worst effect of the pesticides
C：all the dangerous effects of pesticides are now known
D：the chemicals may also cause these effects in humans
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。第3段说明很多杀虫剂会给动物带来诸多不良反应。第4段第1、2句说明这一研究的意义：这些研究结果意义深远。考虑到各种的副作用，人们必然会思考这样一个问题：由于孩子们将与这些有害物质有长时间的连续接触，那么在学校里继续使用这些杀虫剂是不是明智之举？由此可推知，选项D正确。

2. Children are more likely to suffer the negative effects of pesticides than adults because _____ .
A：children absorb more pesticides than adults
B：pesticides are used more in areas with children
C：the pesticides used in schools are more dangerous
D：adults know more about pesticides than children
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于事实细节题。相关信息在第2段第2句：同样是1磅的东西，孩子们吃的、喝的以及呼吸的气体都要多于成年人，所有这一切使得他们受到那些大多数人每天都要接触的化学制品的负面影响更严重。由此可知，选项A符合句意。

3. The main point of this text is that ______ .
A：pesticides are dangerous and their uses need to be reevaluated
B：children suffer most from the effects of pesticides
C：schools are most responsible for pesticide-related illnesses
D：pesticides should be eliminated everywhere
正确答案：A
属于主旨思想题。文章第1段第2句以however引出真正的主题：然而，愈来愈多的证据表明包括杀虫剂在内的化学品暴露在环境中会导致一些疾病的发生。接下来的几段介绍了其具体的负面影响、有关研究结果及解决办法等。最后一段总结上文，强调指出：鉴于接触低剂量杀虫剂会给长期健康带来副作用……无论成人还是小孩都需谨慎，尽量减少与有害化学制品的接触，并且考虑使用含有尽可能少的有害物质的化学杀虫剂，或者使用不含化学成分的其他杀虫剂代用品。由此可见，选项A正确。

4. The author mentions the exaggerated effects of chemicals on children in Paragraph 2 to ____ .
A：prove that pesticides are dangerous to all humans
B：show that children are more susceptible to many kinds of dangers
C：suggest a solution to the problem of pesticides
D：identify one group that pesticides hurt in particular
正确答案：A
答案为D，属于信息推断题。第2段第1句指出：孩子们尤其易受有毒物质的侵蚀。接下来的句子和段落都围绕着孩子和学校说明接触和使用杀虫剂的种种害处，进而提出忠告和解决办法。可见，孩子在文中只是作为一组受到杀虫剂影响的特殊研究对象。因此，选项D正确。

5. The author cites the American Medical Association’s advice in Paragraph 5 to _____ .
A：present more factual details to clarify the issue
B：present an alternative theory for consideration
C：present a recommendation from a reputable source
D：present a solution drawn from all the evidence considered
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推断题。American Medical Association的建议出现在第5段第2句（译文参见第8题），从用词regarding，prudent，consider来看，显然这只是提供一个较权威的建议，因此，选项C正确。

 Passage Three
  From the health point of view we are living in a marvelous age. We are immunized from birth against many of the most dangerous diseases.  A large number of once fatal illnesses can now be cured by modern drugs and surgery. It is almost certain that one day remedies will be found for the most stubborn remaining diseases. The expectation of life has increased enormously. But though the possibility of living a long and happy life is greater than ever before, every day we witness the incredible slaughter of them, women and children on the roads, man versus the motor-car! It is a never-ending battle in which man is losing. Thousands of people the world over are killed or horribly killed each year and we are quietly sitting back and letting it happen. It has been rightly said that when a man is sitting behind a steering wheel, his car becomes the extension of his personality. There is no doubt that the motor-car often brings out a man's very worst qualities. People who are normally quiet and pleasant may become unrecognizable when they are behind a steering wheel. They swear, they are ill-mannered and aggressive, willful as two-year-olds and utterly selfish. All their hidden frustrations, disappointments and jealousies seem to be brought to the surface by the act of driving.
The surprising thing is that the society smiles so gently on the motorist and seems to forgive his behavior. Everything is done for his convenience. Cities are allowed to become almost uninhabitable because of heavy traffic; towns are made ugly by huge car parks; the countryside is desecrated by road networks; and the mass annual slaughter becomes nothing more than a statistic, to be conveniently forgotten. It is high time a world code were created to reduce this senseless waste of human life. With regard to driving, the laws of some countries are notoriously lax and even the strictest are not strict enough.
     A code which was universally accepted could only have a dramatically beneficial effect on the accident rate. Here are a few examples of some of the things that might be done. The driving test should be standardized and made far more difficult than it is; all the drivers should be made to take a test every three years or so; the age at which young people are allowed to drive any vehicle should be raised to at least 21; all vehicles should be put through strict annual tests for safety.  Even the smallest amount of alcohol in the blood can impair a person's driving ability. Present drinking and driving laws (where they exist) should be made much stricter. Maximum and minimum speed limits should be imposed on all roads.
Governments should lay down safety specifications for manufacturers, as has been done in the USA. All advertising stressing power and performance should be banned. These measures may sound inordinately harsh.  But surely nothing should be considered as too severe if it results in reducing the annual toll of human life. After all, the world is for human beings, not for motor-cars.

1. The main idea of this passage is _______.
A：traffic accidents are mainly caused by motorists
B：thousands of people the world over are killed each year
C：the laws of some countries about driving are too lax
D：only stricter traffic laws can prevent accidents
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于主旨思想题。分析可知，文章的中心思想为严格的交通法规才能对事故起到预防作用，故答案为D。

2. What does the author think of society toward motorists?
A：Society criticizes the motorists severely.
B：Huge car parks are built in the cities and towns.
C：Society overlooks their rude driving.
D：Victims of accidents are nothing.
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。文中第2段首句提及社会对于汽车司机过于温和，宽恕他们造成的诸多不便，由此可推知，答案为C。

3. Why does the author say “his car becomes the extension of his personality“?
A：Driving can show his real self.
B：Driving can show part of his personality.
C：Driving can bring out his character.
D：His car embodies his temper.
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于信息推断题。题干中提及的句子在第1段中。在本段的最后3句中提及，汽车经常会呈现人品质中坏的一面，并列举一系列的坏品质，由此可推知，答案为A。

4. Which of the followings is NOT mentioned as a way to against traffic accidents?
A：Build more highways.
B：Stricter driving tests.
C：Test drivers every three years.
D：Raise age limit and lay down safety specifications.
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于是非判断题。在文中第4段提及了一些减少事故的措施，B、C、D都明确提到，而A选项“要修更多的路”并没有提及，故答案为A。

5. The attitude of the author is _______ .
A：ironical
B：critical
C：appealing
D：militant
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于态度推断题。文中第2段末句提及对于驾驶，很多国家的法律太轻，甚至最严厉的法规也不够严厉。最后一段呼吁各国制定严格的交通法则，由此可推知，答案为B。

Passage Two
  Dreams are said to be the window to the mind. Through the study of dreams, we can catch glimpses into what our subconscious minds are thinking, or what is troubling us at our deepest levels. Not all dreams are the same, however, either in content or in meaning. In this respect, the study of bad dreams, nightmares, can yield interesting observations in regard to the mind and status of the dreamer. Indeed, nightmares appear to have been the subject of far more studies than more pleasant dreams, if for no other reason that while pleasant dreams are easily forgotten upon awakening, nightmares tend to linger in our minds is sufficient to demand attention.
The sources of our dreams are most commonly attributed to factors in our waking lives. Whether it be emotional challenges, stress in the workplace, relationship problems or a myriad of other possible factors, the thoughts and feelings created in our waking environments are believed to directly influence the content of our dreams. A particular dramatic or traumatic experience during the day would no doubt be encountered again in some form or another during the night.
Just as important as actual events in the determination of the content of our dreams are the pre- existing beliefs that we hold.  If we encounter some kind of phenomena m our dreams, it is very likely that we already believed in the possibility of the phenomena before the dream. For example, if someone dreams of being abducted by aliens, it's very likely that, before the dream, he already believed in the existence of aliens. To the extent that dreams are direct reflections of our minds, they will reflect accurately what we believe and hold to be true.
    The way that we act in dreams bears consideration as well. Oftentimes, our behavior in our dreams reflects hidden desires for that type of behavior in our waking lives. Someone who dreams of revenge may actually desire revenge in real life, and likewise someone who dreams of adventure night after night may be experiencing his mind playing out a desire for more excitement in his everyday life.
While the items encountered in our dreams are of great importance in the analysis of dreams, it must be recognized and understood that the same item in two different dreams can easily have entirely different meanings for the two dreamers. For example, a horse in the dreams of an avid equestrian can signify comfort and relaxation, whereas the same horse in the dreams of a hunter can represent excitement and challenge.

1. Nightmares are mentioned in Paragraph 1 in order to _______ .
A：pay attention to the main subject of the text
B：give an example of one particularly vivid type of dream
C：provide a justification for the study of dreams
D：illustrate the value of analyzing dreams
正确答案：B

2. Based on the information provided in Paragraph 3, if a man dreamed of being hit by a train, it is likely that he ______ .
A：has been hit by a train before
B：believes in the existence of trains
C：believes that it is possible for him to be hit by a train
D：is afraid of being hit by a train
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推断题。第3段第2句指出：如果我们梦见某种现象，那么很可能在此之前我们就相信了这种现象是有可能存在的。据此，我们可推断：如果一个人梦见被火车撞了，那么很可能他早就相信了有这种可能性的存在，即选项C正确。

B：in order to understand the meaning of dreams, we must analyze the lives of the dreamers
C：dreams can reveal much about the personality of a dreamer
D：the study of dreams, while multi-faceted, is a worthwhile endeavor
正确答案：A

 Passage Three
  Always at the beginning of any particular hunt there was one solemn ceremony to perform: an earnest consultation between all the hunters as to which spoor was most worthwhile following. The Bushmen would sit on their heels like elder statesmen discussing the size, mood, sex, and direction of the animals, study the wind, the sun, the hour and the weather generally. When they had picked out one particular spoor they revealed their decision by flicking their hands over it loosely from their wrists and making a sound like the wind between their teeth. They would do that, too, whenever spoor was fresh and promising and the gesture came so clearly from a background of meaning that we never saw it without an immediate quickening of our own pulses.
The decision made, they would set out at a steady trot, until there was evidence that their quarry was near. Sometimes they would stalk it, first on their knees and finally full on the stomach, until the animal came within range of their bows. Frequently, if seen, they would make no effort to hide themselves but go slowly, hands behind their backs, imitating the movements of ostriches pecking casually at the food in the veld. When hunting in a group they seemed to prefer shooting in pairs, coming up together on their knees like shadows within a bush. Without a word being spoken but by some process of wordless intercommunication of purpose, simultaneously they would let fly their arrow at the animal, the bowstrings resounding with a wild harp-like twang. That done they would stand up at leisure. They never expected the animal to drop dead at once, knowing they would have to wait until the poison began to do its deadly work.
But the first thing to establish was that the arrows had found their mark. The arrows were made in three sections for this very reason. First, the poisoned head was made in one short hollowed piece which fitted into another slightly larger one which was joined to the main shaft, notched at the far end to take the bow-string without slipping or fumbling. This made certain that the wounded animal would be unable to rid itself of the arrow by rubbing its wounded place against a tree, for in this way the arrow-shaft either parted from the arrow-head on impact, or else when the animal started rubbing itself against trunks and thorn bushes. If the hunters recovered the arrows intact, of course, they made no attempt to follow the alerted quarry. But if they found only the shaft they would take up the spoor at once and the real business of the hunt began. How long it took before they closed in for the kill with their spears on an animal already half paralyzed by poison, depended on the sort of poison used, the size of the animal, and the nature and place of the wound. Sometimes the chase would last only an hour or two, but with the greatest of all quarries, the eland, it sometimes took a whole day.
I have never seen a killing which seemed more innocent. It was killing in order to live. On their faces there was always an expression of profound relief and gratitude when the hunter's quest had been fulfilled. There was also a desire to complete the killing as quickly as possible. I have watched their faces many times while performing this deed and I could see only the strain of the hunt, the signs of fatigue from running all day under a cloudless sky in a high temperature, together with a kind of dedicated expression, but no gloating, or killing for the sake of killing.

1. According to the passage the hunters kill their prey by _______ .
A：following their spoor
B：shooting them with spears
C：trapping them
D：shooting them with poisoned arrows
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于事实细节题。由文章第三段“How long it took before they closed in for the kill with their spears on an animal already half paralyzed by poison,  depended on the sort of poison used，the size of the animal，and the nature and place of the wound”可知，猎人射杀猎物使用的是长矛。故答案为B。

2. What did the writer find it is exciting to see?
A：Animals being chased and killed.
B：The hunter's hand gestures signaling a target
C：The way the arrows are made.
D：The way hunters find their quarry.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文章首段最后一句提出：不论什么时候，只要足迹是刚刚留下的或者有捕到的希望，他们也会做出这种动作。如果我们在他们所处的背景下看到他们那种坚决、明了的手势，脉搏同样会加快跳动。题干中exciting与文中quickening of our own pulses是同义转换，文中令作者脉搏加速的原因是看到猎手们的手势。结合文章内容可知，这种动作是猎人在发现新的猎物足迹时所发出的，选项D与文章信息一致。故答案为D。

3. The writer considers the hunters as ______ .
A：sportsmen
B：humane killers
C：childlike savages
D：cunning ostrich impersonators
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于信息推断题。文中最后一段首句提及：“我”未曾见过比这更无罪的( innocent)杀戮，这是为了生存而进行的杀戮(killing in order to live)。本段最后一句也提及没有幸灾乐祸，或者只是为了杀戮而杀戮。由此可推知，作者并不认为猎人猎杀动物是残忍的，相反这是一种为了生存而进行的行为，选项中与文章意义最接近的是B：人道的猎杀者。故答案为B。

4. According to the passage, the hunters imitate ostriches because ______ .
A：they want to gain the trust of their intended prey
B：they would like to entertain each other after a hard day's work
C：ostriches are easier to imitate than elands
D：if seen they could hide their heads in the ground
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于事实细节题。由题干中的ostriches定位信息在第二段，段中提及：被猎物发现也是常有的事，这时他们也不会去努力隐藏自己，而是缓慢移动，双手放在背后，模仿草原上随意啄食的鸵鸟的动作。由此可知，猎人模仿鸵鸟的目的在于不引起猎物的注意，从而捕杀它们，选项A与文章信息一致，故答案为A。

5. If the hunters found only the shaft of an arrow, it meant most importantly ______ .
A：there was an animal dying somewhere
B：the arrow was well made
C：the arrow was badly made
D：they would never find arrow-head
正确答案：A
答案为A，信息推断题。由题干中的the shaft of an arrow定位信息在第三段。段中提及：若狩猎者找回来的箭是完好无损的（the arrow intact），当然没必要再去追踪已产生警觉的猎物。若找回来的只有箭杆( only the shaft)，他们会马上沿着足迹追踪，一场真正的狩猎活动就此开始。由此可推知，只剩下剑杆就说明猎物已经被射中，后文中也提及：被箭射伤并因中毒而处于半瘫痪的猎物。选项A与文章信息一致，故答案为A。

【精粹阅读】ReadingComprehension05
1. The main purpose of this text is to ________ .
A：inform the reader as to what causes the phenomenon of deja vu
B：weigh the validity of various theories regarding the basis of deja vu
C：present different theories that explain deja vu for the reader's consideration
D：argue that deja vu is a contentious issue through the listing of various opposing viewpoints
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于主旨思想题。文章第1段最后一句就是本文的中心：在这些“似曾经历”的感觉所代表的意义背后，存在着众多的理论。下文都是这些理论的介绍。故选项C正确。

2. In Paragraph 2, “...it is not a far stretch to believe that...“ is most similar in use to _______ .
A：it is sometimes believed that
B：the most likely conclusion is that
C：it logically follows that
D：it is not unreasonable to believe that
正确答案：A
答案为D．属于信息推断题。...it is not afar stretch to believe that...（词面意思：相信……并不需要太长的时间）在第2段第2句，前半句提到“那些相信轮回转世说这一理论的人，相信我们的灵魂会在死后于新的肉身上得到新生”，由此可推知“要他们相信在死亡及重生过程中，我们留存在记忆中的一些印象仍会保存在心灵之中也不应是什么难事”，即顺理成章。因此，选项D正确。

3. An example of ESP, as described in Paragraph 3, is _______ .
A：seeing through solid objects
B：sensing danger before it occurs
C：being able to communicate with animals
D：the ability to understand ideas and issues that most other humans cannot
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词ESP出现在第3段第1句，由ESP后面的逗号可判断后面的句子是它的同位语，是对它的进一步的解释：……“超感知觉”指的是超越我们正常的五种感觉……之外的那种感知事物的能力。第2句又补充道：对相信超感知觉的人来说，一个人“似曾见过”……并不是在过去生活中见到的，而是通过超感知觉以预感的形式看到的。由此可知，选项B正确。

4. In Paragraph 4, “...it has two records of it...“ is most similar in use to ______ .
A：it senses it as two memories of the same incident
B：it stores the information as memories of the same senses
C：it senses it as having occurred twice
D：it puts the two phenomena together into one memory
正确答案：A
答案为C，属于信息推断题。...it has two“records”of it...在第4段最后一句：因此，当大脑最终完成对感觉器官传递来的数据的评估时，就拥有这一数据的双份记录（一份是感觉器官的，另一份是大脑的），但两份记录同样真实。再结合本段第2句内容，不难推知，这种感觉就像事情发生了两次一样，故选项C正确。

5. The author views deja vu as ______ .
A：an issue that defies explanation, forcing one to rely on supposition
B：the phenomenon that is best answered by science
C：a contentious issue that is hard to resolve
D：a question with different answers based on whether one believes in religion, mysticism or science most strongly
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于态度推断题。文章第1段最后一句指出：有关“似曾经历”的感觉，存在着众多的理论；第2、3、4段分别介绍了三种不同的理论，由每段第1句中的信号词及第4段第1句便可判定，对于“似曾经历”这一现象，本文并无定论。由此可见，选项C正确。

Passage Two
  At 5:15 a m. of April 18, 1906, the greatest earthquake disaster in the history of the United States occurred. At that crucial moment, San Francisco and the surrounding area were rocked by huge movements in the earth underneath, causing previously unheard of damage above. The loss in money, lives and peace of mind were such that it took decades for San Francisco to recover, and still haunts the memory of that great city to this day .
As the first massive quake hit the sleeping city, buildings tumbled and chaos suddenly reigned in the streets. Amid bursting gas mains, falling debris and raging fires, panic held sway over the citizenry as each fled from the destruction all around them. People fled to the safety of parks, far from the toppling skyscrapers, as martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check.
Fire swept across the city as the broken gas mains caught fire and occasionally exploded. Brave firemen rushed to the scenes of disaster, only to find that the central water main had also been destroyed by the quake, leaving them helpless to watch as the fires raged on and spread further and further.
     A second massive shock hit the crumbled city at 8:00 a. m., nearly three hours after the first. Although the most serious fires began in the business district, as time progressed, it was clear that the loss in life was mainly suffered in the poorer areas of the city, under which most of the burning gas mains ran.  After all was said and done, the final death tolls were horrifyingly high. In addition, nearly all the major buildings in the city were reduced to rubble, including City Hall, the new Post Office, the Parrot Building ( previously the largest department store in the West) , the Chronicle and Examiner Buildings ( San Francisco's two major newspapers) , and Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto.
In the wake of the destruction, urban planners immediately set to work to rebuild the shattered city. They did this with gusto, designing new buildings, pipes and streets with earthquake safety in mind. These ongoing precautions no doubt contributed to the phenomenal performance of the city's infrastructure during the earthquake of 1989, in which, although millions of dollars in damage occurred, widespread major destruction and loss of life were avoided.

1. In Paragraph 2, the phrase “...martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check“ means ______.
A：without martial law, the madness would have been uncontrollable
B：martial law was the only means by which the madness could be controlled
C：martial law was the method chosen to control the madness
D：martial law succeeded in controlling the situation
正确答案：A
答案为C，属于信息推断题。...martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check在 第2段最后一句，由上下文得知：地震发生时，全城居民处于极度恐慌之中。后来人们纷纷远离倒塌的摩天大楼，逃往公园中的安全地带，这是由于军管法强令控制了老百姓中的恐慌现象。由此可知，选项C正确。

2. The mentioning of the various buildings destroyed implies that ______ .
A：almost all aspects of importance in the city suffered as a result of the earthquake
B：the major functions of the city could no longer be performed after the earthquake
C：the most major damage from the earthquake came in the form of those buildings listed
D：the damage caused by the earthquake was specific, but hit the most important areas in the city
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推断题。第4段最后一句：此外，几乎城中的所有主要建筑物都变成一堆瓦砾，市政厅、新邮局、鹦鹉大厦、《纪事报》及《审查者》大厦以及帕洛阿尔托附近的斯坦福大学都在劫难逃。文章拿这些城市重要的基础建筑举例无非是想说明这次地震造成的影响之大。因此，选项A正确。

3. Paragraph 5 suggests that _______ .
A：due to the precautions put in place after the 1906 earthquake, San Francisco is now safe from future earthquakes
B：although damage will probably occur in the next big earthquake in San Francisco, the precautions put in place after 1906 will ensure that none of the damage is major
C：the result of the 1906 earthquake was positive, because it allowed city planners to build a newer, more beautiful and safer city
D：although the 1906 earthquake was tragic, a positive result emerged in the form of increased safety that has already yielded benefits
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。相关内容在第5段最后一句：毫无疑问，不间断地执行这些预防措施也是这座城市的基础设施在1989年地震期间能够保存完好的主要原因，在那场地震中，尽管没能避免数百万美元的损失，但是并未发生大面积的重大破坏以及人员伤亡。由此可知，选项D正确。

4. The author mentions the situation of firemen in Paragraph 3 in order to _______ .
A：demonstrate that even those best equipped to handle the situation were at a loss
B：show that the situation was utterly hopeless
C：explain why the fire crews were unable to contain the damage caused by fire
D：give one example of a group of people that the earthquake particularly hurt
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词firemen出现在第3段第2句：英勇的消防员迅速赶到火灾现场，结果却发现中央供水管道也已经在地震中被毁坏，最后他们只能眼睁睁地看着火势肆虐，蔓延的范围越来越广。由此可推知，再勇敢的消防员即使配备先进的设备也会有无计可施的时候。因此，选项A正确。

5. The story of San Francisco’s reaction to the 1906 earthquake can best be described as ______ .
A：profound loss followed by stoic rebuilding
B：false confidence followed by a lesson learned
C：irretrievable loss followed by grief and mourning
D：a great city shattered and rebuilt, but never the same again
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于信息归纳题。题目问：下面哪个选项可以最恰当地描述1906年旧金山发生的地震？文章第1段是对这次地震的总体介绍；第2、3、4段描述了具体过程及所造成的损失；最后一段突出了旧金山城市重建工作的顺利展开及抗震决心。由此可知，选项A正确。

 Passage Three
  For several years, scientists have been testing a substance called interferon (干扰素), a potential wonder drug that is proving to be effective in treating a variety of ailments, including virus infections, bacteria infections, and tumors. To date, the new drug has provoked no negative reaction of sufficient significance to discourage its use. But in spite of its success, last year only one gram was produced in the entire world.
The reason for the scarcity lies in the structure of interferon. A species of specific protein, the interferon produced from one animal species cannot be used in treating another animal species.  In other words, to treat human beings, only interferon produced by human beings may be used. The drug is produced by infecting white blood cells with a virus. Fortunately, it is so powerful that the amount given each patient per injection is very small.
Unlike antibiotics, interferon does not attack germs directly. Instead, it makes unaffected cells resistant to infection, and prevents the multiplication of viruses within cells.
As you might conclude, one of the most dramatic uses of interferon has been in the treatment of cancer. Dr. Hans Strander, research physician at Sweden's famous Karolinska Institute, has treated more than one hundred cancer patients with the new drug. Among a group of selected patients who have undergone surgical procedures for advanced cancer, half were given interferon. The survival rate over a three-year period was 70 percent among those who were treated with interferon as compared with only 10 t030 percent among those who have received the conventional treatments.
In the United States, a large-scale project supported by the American Cancer Society is now underway. If the experiment is successful, interferon could become one of the greatest medical discoveries of our time.

1. In what does interferon differ from antibiotics?
A：Interferon has serious side effects, whereas antibiotics do not.
B：Interferon is available in large supply, whereas antibiotics are not
C：Antibiotics are very effective, while interferon is not.
D：Antibiotics kill germs by attacking them directly, while interferon does not.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文中第3段首句提及，与抗生素不同的是，干扰素不直 接攻击病菌。由此可知，答案为D。

2. What effect does interferon have on infection?
A：It provokes a negative reaction.
B：It keeps healthy cells from becoming infected.
C：It causes healthy cells to grow.
D：It attacks viruses.
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于事实细节题。文中第3段第2句提及，干扰素的作用是让未感染的细胞具有抗感染性。由此可知，答案为B。

3. Interferon is produced by _______ .
A：infecting viruses, bacteria, and tumors with a drug
B：infecting proteins with a virus
C：infecting white blood cells with a virus
D：infecting viruses with proteins
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于事实细节题。文中第2段倒数第2句提及，通过利用病毒感染白细胞产生该药物。由此可知，答案为C。

4. Interferon has not been widely used because it is ________ .
A：still very dangerous
B：being tested in the United States
C：difficult to produce in large quantities
D：not effective for human beings
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于信息推断题。文中最后一段提及该药在美国尚在试验之中，由此可推知，药品还没有大范围使用，故答案为B。

5. Which of the following is true of the results of Dr. Stander’s experiments?
A：Both interferon and conventional treatments should be used to ensure the survival of the patients.
B：At the end of three years, only ten to thirty percent of the patients who had not received interferon died.
C：Only the patients who received interferon survived.
D：Most of the patients who were treated with inferno survived.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文中第4段的末句提及使用干扰素的患者的存活率是70%，由此可知，使用干扰素治疗的大部分患者存活了，故答案为D。

  Passage Two
       Competitors complain that Microsoft's recent settlement of their antitrust case with the federal government will do little to protect them or consumers from the software giant's monopoly power. But they hold out hope that state attorney generals could make the deal more restrictive.  "My guess is that all Bill Gates could do was to suppress a big grin when he held his press conference this morning," said Mitchell Kertzman, chief executive of Liberate Technologies, a rival provider of software for interactive TV.  "This settlement doesn't come close to matching the scope of the violations of antitrust law that Microsoft has been convicted of," he added. "It was an inexplicably bad deal for the government. "
     Microsoft and the Justice Department presented the settlement to a federal judge this Friday, saying it would end the antitrust case in a way that would help the sagging economy. U. S.  District Judge Colleen Kollar Kotelly agreed to review it and gave the 18 states involved in the case until Tuesday to decide whether to accept the plan.
     Several competitors called on the state attorney generals to insist on making changes to the settlement. Sun Microsystems' general counsel, Michael Morris, said the Justice Department was walking away from a case they had already won. " Paul T. Cappuccio, the general counsel for AOL Time Warner, said the settlement "does too little to promote competition and protect consumers, and can too easily be evaded by a determined monopolist like Microsoft. "
The state attorney generals had been pressing for stiffer penalties, but on Friday, several said some progress had been made. Among the key elements of the settlement, Microsoft would have to:
  Help rivals make products compatible with the Windows operating system, which runs 91% of the world's computers.
  Stop using exclusive deals with computer sellers to put competitors at a disadvantage.
  Let three in-house, independent experts monitor its compliance.
    "We're quite disappointed. We believe that there are a lot of issues that haven't been addressed," said Michael Mace, chief officer of handheld computer maker Palm, "which makes an operating system that competes with one from Microsoft." Several tech executives said the settlement was too focused on restricting Microsoft's Windows monopoly, and not its broader business practices and non-PC initiatives.
"This is a reward, not a remedy. It fails to terminate the illegal monopoly and fails to unfetter the market from anticompetitive conduct," said Kelly Jo MacArthur, general counsel for Real Networks, which makes music and video software threatened by Windows Media Player. "This agreement allows a declared illegal monopolist to determine, at its sole discretion, what goes into the monopoly operating system in the future," she added.
 

1. We can infer from the text that the main issue behind Microsoft’s antitrust case is the need ____ .
A：to boost a sagging economy
B：to limit the reach of Microsoft's Windows operating system
C：to prevent Microsoft from monopolizing the computer industry
D：for Microsoft to assist its competitors in making products compatible with Windows
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。文章第1段第1句指出：竞争对手抱怨微软最近和联邦政府达成的反托拉斯案件的协议对保护他们和消费者免受这个软件巨人的垄断控制起不了什么作用。倒数第2段最后一句又补充道：数位技术管理人员说这个协议只着重于限制微软视窗的垄断，而没有考虑到更广泛的经营活动以及非个人计算机的创新业务。由此可知，选项 C正确。

2. The comment from Michael Morris (Para.3) implies that the Justice Department ______ .
A：had just wrapped up a successful case
B：missed a chance to more stringently regulate Microsoft
C：was leaving most of the work to the state attorney generals involved
D：had failed in their mission to protect business competition.
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词Michael Morris，Justice Department出现在第3段第2句：……迈克尔•莫里斯说，司法部“正从已经获得胜利的案件中脱身”。再结合其上下文分析可知，司法部错过了一个更加严格地约束微软的好机会。因此，选项B正确。

3. The fourth paragraph suggests that most of the state attorney generals _______ .
A：were under pressure from Microsoft's competitors to demand changes in the settlement
B：felt that the settlement was at least partially successful
C：felt the penalties against Microsoft were too harsh
D：believed that the settlement was a sign of progress for the computer industry
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。第4段第1句指出：国家首席检察官们一直在竭力要求实行更加严厉的处罚，而星期五，数位首席检察官说已经取得了进展。由此可知，他们认为这一案子至少已经取得了部分的成功，故选项B正确。

4. What provision of the settlement is meant to ensure its enforcement?
A：The review of a federal judge.
B：The review and approval by 18 state attorney generals.
C：The monitoring by independent experts installed at Microsoft.
D：The watchful eyes of Microsoft's numerous competitors.
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。协议的主要内容在第5、6、7段：帮助对手生产与世界上91%的计算机使用的视窗操作系统兼容的产品；停止与计算机销售商达成排他性的协议而使竞争对手处于不利的地位；允许三位进驻公司的独立专家监督协议的遵守情况。显然，最后一条是本题的答案，即选项C。

5. This text is mainly about _______ .
A：the role of the federal government in managing disputes in technology industry
B：Microsoft's settlement of the antitrust case with the federal government
C：Microsoft's monopoly over the computer industry
D：competitors' responses to Microsoft's antitrust settlement
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于主旨思想题。文章第1段第1句就指出“竞争对手对微软最近和联邦苻达成的反托拉斯案件的协议有怨言”。接下来的几段详细介绍了有关协议及其竞争对手对拘意见和反应。由此可见，本文重点讲述了竞争对手们对微软反托拉斯案件达成的协议的立，即选项D正确。

 Passage Three
  What do the consumers really want? That's a question market researchers would love to answer. But since people don't always say what they think, marketers would need direct access to consumers' thoughts to get the truth.
     Now, in a way, that is possible. At the "Mind of the Market" laboratory at Harvard Business School, researchers are looking inside shoppers' skulls to develop more effective advertisements and marketing pitches. Using imaging techniques that measure the blood flow to various parts of the brain, the Harvard team hopes to predict how consumers will react to particular products and to discover the most effective ways to present information. Stephen Kosslyn, a professor of psychology at Harvard, and Business School professor Cerald Zaltman, oversee the lab. The goal is not to manipulate people's preference," says Kosslyn, "just to speak to their actual desires."  The group's finding, though still preliminary, could radically change how firms develop and market new products.
The Harvard group use position emission topography (PET) scans to monitor the brain activity. These PET scans, along with other non-invasive imaging techniques, enable researchers to see which parts of the brain are active during specific tasks (such as remembering a word).  Correlations have been found between blood flow to specific areas and future behavior. Because of this, Harvard researchers believe the scans can also predict future purchasing patterns. According to an unpublished paper the group produced, "It's possible to use these techniques to predict not only whether people will remember and have specific emotional reactions to certain materials, but also whether they will be inclined to want those materials months later."
The Harvard group is now moving into the next stage of experiments. They will explore how people remember advertisements as part of an effort to predict how they will react to a product after having seen an ad. The researchers believe that once key areas of the brain identified, scans on about two dozen volunteers will be enough to draw conclusions about the reactions of specific segments of the population. Large corporations-including Coca Cola, Eastman Kodak, General Motors, and Hallmark-have already signed up to fund further investigations.
For their financial support, these firms gain access to the experiments but cannot control them. If Kosslyn and Zaltman and their team really can read the mind of the market, the consumers may find it even harder to get those advertising jingles out of their heads.
   

1. Which of the following statements can be the best title for this passage?
A：Reading the Mind of the Market
B：Controlling the Consumers' Preference
C：Improving the Styles of Advertising
D：Finding Out the Way to Predict
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于主旨思想题。参照文章第2段中“Mind of the Market”laboratory和尾段的If Kosslyn and Zaltman and their team really can read the mind of the market可以推断出选项A正确答案。

2. Why do the Harvard researchers use scientific technology in the experiments?
A：Because they don't believe the surveys done by the marketers can lead to the truth.
B：Because they are asked by the marketers to find a direct way to read the consumers' thoughts.
C：Because they want to find out how the ads influence people's brain activity, emotional responses, etc.
D：Because they expect that their experiments can basically alter the marketing strategies of product.
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推理题。文中第2段第4句提及该实验的目的不是操纵人们的喜，而是要对顾客的实际需求做出反应。由此判断，选项C为正确答案。

3. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?
A：Sometimes people will conceal what they think when being questioned by the market researchers.
B：Stephen Kosslyn and Gerald Zaltman overlook the experiments and criticize the purpose of the study.
C：Harvard researchers have found the corresponding relations between people's brain and behavior.
D：There are many large organizations endorsing and financing the Harvard group's further investigation.
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于是非判断题。文中第2段第4句话提及“oversee”，而不是选项B中的 overlook”，由此判断，选项B正确。

4. What does “to speak to“ in the fifth sentence of the second paragraph mean?
A：to talk to
B：to say to
C：to communicate to
D：to respond to
正确答案：D
答案为D．属于词义推断题。提出的关键词speak to出现在第2段第4句话：“The goal not to manipulate people's preference,”says Kosslyn,“just to speak to their actual desires.”本句意思为，实验的目的不是操纵人们的喜好，而是要对顾客的实际需求做出反应。故选项D正确答案。

5. The last sentence of this passage implies that _______.
A：if the experiments' results can be applied to the practice, the customers will be likely to buy things according to the ads
B：if the Harvard group can succeed in finishing the research they will use it in attracting more and more consumers into the market
C：the financial supporting corporations such as Coca Cola, General Motors can employ the experiments in their own marketing
D：the consumers may discover that those ads will always annoy them by jingling out of their heads and cause them headaches
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推理题。文中第4段首句提到，哈佛的研究团队正在进行新一轮试验，即：研究人们如何记住产品广告，并借此来预测人们看到一个广告后，对该产品反如何。由此推理，选项A正确。

 Passage Two
  For centuries in Spain and Latin America, heading home for lunch and a snooze with the family was something like a national right, but with global capitalism standardizing work hours, this idyllic habit is fast becoming an endangered pleasure.  Ironically, all this is happening just as researchers are beginning to note the health benefits of the mid-afternoon nap.
According to a nationwide survey, less than 25 percent of Spaniards still enjoy siestas. And like Spain, much of Latin America has adopted Americanized work schedules, too, with shortened lunch time and more rigid work hours.  Last year the Mexican government passed a law limiting lunch breaks to one hour and requiring its employees to work their eight-hour shift between 7 a. m.  and 6 p. m. Before the mandate, workers would break up the shift-going home midday for a long break with the family and returning to work until about 90r 10 p. m. The idea of siesta is changing in Greece, Italy and Portugal, too, as they rush to join their more "industrious" counterparts in the global market.
Most Americans I know covet sleep, but the idea of taking a nap mid-afternoon equates with laziness, unemployment and general sneakiness. Yet according to a National Sleep Survey poll, 65 percent of adults do not get enough sleep. Numerous scientific studies document the benefits of nap taking, including one I997 study on the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation in the journal Internal Medicine. The researchers found that fatigue harms not only marital and social relations but worker productivity.
According to Mark Rosekind, a former NASA scientist and founder of Alertness Solutions in Cupertino, Calif.,  which educates busine96es about the advantages of sanctioning naps,  we're biologically programmed to get sleepy between 3 and 5 p.m. and 3 and 5 a.m. Our internal timekeeper - called the circadian clock-operates on a 24-hour rotation and every 12 hours there's a dip.  In accordance with these natural sleep rhythms, Rosekind recommends that naps be either for 40 minutes or for two hours. Latin American countries, asserts Rosekind, have had it right all along. They've been in sync with their clocks; we haven't.
Since most of the world is sleep-deprived, getting well under the recommended eight hours a night( adults get an average of 6.5 hours nightly) , we usually operate on a kind of idle midday.  Naps are even more useful now that most of us forfeit sleep because of insane work schedules, longer commute times and stress. In a study published last April, Brazilian medical researchers noted that blood pressure and arterial blood pressure dropped during a siesta.

1. In the second sentence of Paragraph l, “all this“ refers to ______.
A：the habit of napping
B：the standardizing of work hours
C：the decline of the siesta tradition
D：the growth of global capitalism
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于指代关系题。分析上下文可知，all this指的是上文中的this idyllic habit is fast becoming an endangered pleasure。因此，选项C正确。

2. We can infer from the second paragraph that Mexican workers now ______ .
A：work fewer hours than in the past
B：get home from work much later than in the past
C：work more reasonable hours than in the past
D：finish the workday earlier than in the past
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词Mexican workers出现在本段第3、4句：去年墨西哥政府通过一条法律，把午休时间缩短为1小时，并要求员工从上午7点到下午6点之间完成8小时的工作。此前，工人们中午暂时停止工作，回家同家人一起休息很长一段时间，然后再回去工作直到晚上九、十点钟左右。由此不难推出选项D项正确。

3. The word “covet“ in Paragraph 3 most likely means _______ .
A：need
B：desire
C：lack
D：value
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于词义推断题。根据第3段第1句可知：我认识的大多数美国人都 covet sleep，但是睡午觉的想法就等同于懒惰、失业以及总要偷偷摸摸。关联词but的使用表明后面的内容与前文意思的转折。由此可知，大多数美国人都渴望睡眠，故正确答案为 B项。

4. The author suggests that most Americans feel that _______ .
A：Spanish culture is inefficient
B：nap-taking will put their jobs at risk
C：nap-taking is a sign of laziness

 Passage Three
  There are a number of formats for reporting research, such as articles to appear in journals, reports addressed to funding agencies, theses or dissertations as part of the requirements for university degrees, and papers to be presented at conferences. These formats differ from one another mostly in their purposes and the audiences whom they address. We will now briefly describe them.
The journal article is a way of reporting research for professional journals or edited collections. The research is reporting in a brief, yet informative way, focusing mostly on the main features of the research such as the purpose, review of the literature ( often referred to as " background" ) , procedures used for carrying out the research accompanied by tables, charts, and graphs, and interpretations of the results (often referred to as discussion) .
The content and emphasis of the journal article will vary according to the intended readers (researchers or practitioners) and it is important for the researchers to be aware of the background and interest of the readers of the journal. Articles intended to be read by practitioners will emphasize the practical implications and recommendations of the research, while articles intended to be read by researchers will describe in detail the method used to collect data, the construction of data collection procedures, and the techniques used for analyzing the data. It is important for the novice researchers to be aware of the fact that articles submitted to journals go through a process of evaluation by experts who make a judgment and recommend whether they should be published or not.
The thesis or dissertation is a format for reporting research which graduate students write as part of fulfilling the requirements for an advanced academic degree. The student is expected to describe in great detail all the phases of the research so it can be examined and evaluated carefully by the reader. Thus the thesis or dissertation includes the purpose and significance of the study, the rationale, a thorough review of the literature, detailed information as to the research tools and the procedures involved in their development, a description of data analysis and the results, and an interpretation of the results in the form of conclusions, implications, and recommendation. This detailed description of the process of the research is needed to provide the professors with an indication of the student's ability to carry out research.
The conference paper is a way of reporting research at conferences, seminars and colloquia.  At such meetings research papers are usually presented orally. They are similar to the research article since research is reported in a concise, yet informative way, focusing on the most essential elements of the research. Handouts and transparencies can also accompany the presentations. As with the research article, here too, the audience present at the meeting, and whether they are researchers or practitioners.

 Passage Two
  The use of chemicals in almost all areas of life has become a commonplace phenomenon. There is growing evidence, however, that chemicals in the environment, including pesticides, may contribute to some illnesses. While studies are still being conducted, preliminary conclusions point to the verdict that such chemicals are indeed negatively impacting those humans to whom they are exposed.
Children are especially vulnerable to toxic substances. Pound for pound, they eat, drink and breathe more than adults, all of which exposes them more heavily to those chemicals to which most individuals encounter on a daily basis. Furthermore, their bodies are still in developing stages, exacerbating the negative effects of those chemicals which negatively impact them.
Of 50 types of pesticides commonly used in American schools, a study conducted by the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides found that many caused negative reactions in laboratory animals. Such negative effects included kidney and liver damage, cancer and neurological and reproductive problems.
These implications of these findings are far-reaching. Given the variety of harmful effects attributed to those pesticides tested, one must pause and consider whether it is wise to continue their use in the nation's schools, where children will be constantly exposed to them. Activists have lobbied for the elimination of such use with a degree of success, and recent findings, if supported by further analysis and confirmation, may help further the cause. A long term solution or alternative, however, remains elusive.
In the short run, however, there may be some measures that can be taken to mitigate the harmful effects of dangerous pesticides. The American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs concluded in a 1997 report that given the "particular uncertainty...regarding the long-term health effects of low-dose pesticide exposures" , it is " prudent" for adults and children to limit their exposure and to " consider the use of the least toxic chemical pesticides or non-chemical alternatives".
 

1. The citing of dangerous effects of pesticides on laboratory animals in Paragraph 3 is used to suggest that _______ .
A：scientists are also concerned with the effects of pesticides on animals
B：cancer is the worst effect of the pesticides
C：all the dangerous effects of pesticides are now known
D：the chemicals may also cause these effects in humans
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。第3段说明很多杀虫剂会给动物带来诸多不良反应。第4段第1、2句说明这一研究的意义：这些研究结果意义深远。考虑到各种的副作用，人们必然会思考这样一个问题：由于孩子们将与这些有害物质有长时间的连续接触，那么在学校里继续使用这些杀虫剂是不是明智之举？由此可推知，选项D正确。

2. Children are more likely to suffer the negative effects of pesticides than adults because _____ .
A：children absorb more pesticides than adults
B：pesticides are used more in areas with children
C：the pesticides used in schools are more dangerous
D：adults know more about pesticides than children
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于事实细节题。相关信息在第2段第2句：同样是1磅的东西，孩子们吃的、喝的以及呼吸的气体都要多于成年人，所有这一切使得他们受到那些大多数人每天都要接触的化学制品的负面影响更严重。由此可知，选项A符合句意。

3. The main point of this text is that ______ .
A：pesticides are dangerous and their uses need to be reevaluated
B：children suffer most from the effects of pesticides
C：schools are most responsible for pesticide-related illnesses
D：pesticides should be eliminated everywhere
正确答案：A
属于主旨思想题。文章第1段第2句以however引出真正的主题：然而，愈来愈多的证据表明包括杀虫剂在内的化学品暴露在环境中会导致一些疾病的发生。接下来的几段介绍了其具体的负面影响、有关研究结果及解决办法等。最后一段总结上文，强调指出：鉴于接触低剂量杀虫剂会给长期健康带来副作用……无论成人还是小孩都需谨慎，尽量减少与有害化学制品的接触，并且考虑使用含有尽可能少的有害物质的化学杀虫剂，或者使用不含化学成分的其他杀虫剂代用品。由此可见，选项A正确。

4. The author mentions the exaggerated effects of chemicals on children in Paragraph 2 to ____ .
A：prove that pesticides are dangerous to all humans
B：show that children are more susceptible to many kinds of dangers
C：suggest a solution to the problem of pesticides
D：identify one group that pesticides hurt in particular
正确答案：A
答案为D，属于信息推断题。第2段第1句指出：孩子们尤其易受有毒物质的侵蚀。接下来的句子和段落都围绕着孩子和学校说明接触和使用杀虫剂的种种害处，进而提出忠告和解决办法。可见，孩子在文中只是作为一组受到杀虫剂影响的特殊研究对象。因此，选项D正确。

5. The author cites the American Medical Association’s advice in Paragraph 5 to _____ .
A：present more factual details to clarify the issue
B：present an alternative theory for consideration
C：present a recommendation from a reputable source
D：present a solution drawn from all the evidence considered
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推断题。American Medical Association的建议出现在第5段第2句（译文参见第8题），从用词regarding，prudent，consider来看，显然这只是提供一个较权威的建议，因此，选项C正确。

 Passage Three
  From the health point of view we are living in a marvelous age. We are immunized from birth against many of the most dangerous diseases.  A large number of once fatal illnesses can now be cured by modern drugs and surgery. It is almost certain that one day remedies will be found for the most stubborn remaining diseases. The expectation of life has increased enormously. But though the possibility of living a long and happy life is greater than ever before, every day we witness the incredible slaughter of them, women and children on the roads, man versus the motor-car! It is a never-ending battle in which man is losing. Thousands of people the world over are killed or horribly killed each year and we are quietly sitting back and letting it happen. It has been rightly said that when a man is sitting behind a steering wheel, his car becomes the extension of his personality. There is no doubt that the motor-car often brings out a man's very worst qualities. People who are normally quiet and pleasant may become unrecognizable when they are behind a steering wheel. They swear, they are ill-mannered and aggressive, willful as two-year-olds and utterly selfish. All their hidden frustrations, disappointments and jealousies seem to be brought to the surface by the act of driving.
The surprising thing is that the society smiles so gently on the motorist and seems to forgive his behavior. Everything is done for his convenience. Cities are allowed to become almost uninhabitable because of heavy traffic; towns are made ugly by huge car parks; the countryside is desecrated by road networks; and the mass annual slaughter becomes nothing more than a statistic, to be conveniently forgotten. It is high time a world code were created to reduce this senseless waste of human life. With regard to driving, the laws of some countries are notoriously lax and even the strictest are not strict enough.
     A code which was universally accepted could only have a dramatically beneficial effect on the accident rate. Here are a few examples of some of the things that might be done. The driving test should be standardized and made far more difficult than it is; all the drivers should be made to take a test every three years or so; the age at which young people are allowed to drive any vehicle should be raised to at least 21; all vehicles should be put through strict annual tests for safety.  Even the smallest amount of alcohol in the blood can impair a person's driving ability. Present drinking and driving laws (where they exist) should be made much stricter. Maximum and minimum speed limits should be imposed on all roads.
Governments should lay down safety specifications for manufacturers, as has been done in the USA. All advertising stressing power and performance should be banned. These measures may sound inordinately harsh.  But surely nothing should be considered as too severe if it results in reducing the annual toll of human life. After all, the world is for human beings, not for motor-cars.

1. The main idea of this passage is _______.
A：traffic accidents are mainly caused by motorists
B：thousands of people the world over are killed each year
C：the laws of some countries about driving are too lax
D：only stricter traffic laws can prevent accidents
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于主旨思想题。分析可知，文章的中心思想为严格的交通法规才能对事故起到预防作用，故答案为D。

2. What does the author think of society toward motorists?
A：Society criticizes the motorists severely.
B：Huge car parks are built in the cities and towns.
C：Society overlooks their rude driving.
D：Victims of accidents are nothing.
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。文中第2段首句提及社会对于汽车司机过于温和，宽恕他们造成的诸多不便，由此可推知，答案为C。

3. Why does the author say “his car becomes the extension of his personality“?
A：Driving can show his real self.
B：Driving can show part of his personality.
C：Driving can bring out his character.
D：His car embodies his temper.
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于信息推断题。题干中提及的句子在第1段中。在本段的最后3句中提及，汽车经常会呈现人品质中坏的一面，并列举一系列的坏品质，由此可推知，答案为A。

4. Which of the followings is NOT mentioned as a way to against traffic accidents?
A：Build more highways.
B：Stricter driving tests.
C：Test drivers every three years.
D：Raise age limit and lay down safety specifications.
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于是非判断题。在文中第4段提及了一些减少事故的措施，B、C、D都明确提到，而A选项“要修更多的路”并没有提及，故答案为A。

5. The attitude of the author is _______ .
A：ironical
B：critical
C：appealing
D：militant
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于态度推断题。文中第2段末句提及对于驾驶，很多国家的法律太轻，甚至最严厉的法规也不够严厉。最后一段呼吁各国制定严格的交通法则，由此可推知，答案为B。

Passage Two
  Dreams are said to be the window to the mind. Through the study of dreams, we can catch glimpses into what our subconscious minds are thinking, or what is troubling us at our deepest levels. Not all dreams are the same, however, either in content or in meaning. In this respect, the study of bad dreams, nightmares, can yield interesting observations in regard to the mind and status of the dreamer. Indeed, nightmares appear to have been the subject of far more studies than more pleasant dreams, if for no other reason that while pleasant dreams are easily forgotten upon awakening, nightmares tend to linger in our minds is sufficient to demand attention.
The sources of our dreams are most commonly attributed to factors in our waking lives. Whether it be emotional challenges, stress in the workplace, relationship problems or a myriad of other possible factors, the thoughts and feelings created in our waking environments are believed to directly influence the content of our dreams. A particular dramatic or traumatic experience during the day would no doubt be encountered again in some form or another during the night.
Just as important as actual events in the determination of the content of our dreams are the pre- existing beliefs that we hold.  If we encounter some kind of phenomena m our dreams, it is very likely that we already believed in the possibility of the phenomena before the dream. For example, if someone dreams of being abducted by aliens, it's very likely that, before the dream, he already believed in the existence of aliens. To the extent that dreams are direct reflections of our minds, they will reflect accurately what we believe and hold to be true.
    The way that we act in dreams bears consideration as well. Oftentimes, our behavior in our dreams reflects hidden desires for that type of behavior in our waking lives. Someone who dreams of revenge may actually desire revenge in real life, and likewise someone who dreams of adventure night after night may be experiencing his mind playing out a desire for more excitement in his everyday life.
While the items encountered in our dreams are of great importance in the analysis of dreams, it must be recognized and understood that the same item in two different dreams can easily have entirely different meanings for the two dreamers. For example, a horse in the dreams of an avid equestrian can signify comfort and relaxation, whereas the same horse in the dreams of a hunter can represent excitement and challenge.

1. Nightmares are mentioned in Paragraph 1 in order to _______ .
A：pay attention to the main subject of the text
B：give an example of one particularly vivid type of dream
C：provide a justification for the study of dreams
D：illustrate the value of analyzing dreams
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。由第1段第4句可知：在这一点上，关于噩梦或噩梦的研究可以得出很多有关做梦者的内心及其状况的有趣见解。下文对噩梦和好梦进行了对比，说明噩梦一直以来是更多研究中的主题，因为它不容易被人忘却。由此可知，选项B正确。

2. Based on the information provided in Paragraph 3, if a man dreamed of being hit by a train, it is likely that he ______ .
A：has been hit by a train before
B：believes in the existence of trains
C：believes that it is possible for him to be hit by a train
D：is afraid of being hit by a train
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推断题。第3段第2句指出：如果我们梦见某种现象，那么很可能在此之前我们就相信了这种现象是有可能存在的。据此，我们可推断：如果一个人梦见被火车撞了，那么很可能他早就相信了有这种可能性的存在，即选项C正确。

4. The main point of the text is that _______ .
A：the study of dreams is based on logic from the waking life of the dreamer
B：in order to understand the meaning of dreams, we must analyze the lives of the dreamers
C：dreams can reveal much about the personality of a dreamer
D：the study of dreams, while multi-faceted, is a worthwhile endeavor
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于主旨思想题。第1段指出“梦境是心灵之窗”；第2段分析了“梦境的渊源常可追溯到我们清醒之时经历的一些事情”；第3段指出“……在分析梦境之时，与此同等重要的是我们持有的先人为主的见解及看法”；第4段指出“梦境中的行为举止同样也引发人的思考”；最后一段“……必须承认和理解，同一件物品出现在两个不同的梦中可代表完全不同的意义”。由此可知，选项A正确。

5. The author would most likely agree with the following sentence: ________ .
A：Dreams can be a useful tool in looking into the deeply held beliefs and emotions of the dreamer.
B：Those who study dreams must first study the environment of the dreamer.
C：The study of dreams makes sense if we know what to look for.
D：Dreamers should pay attention to their dreams to discern what those dreams reveal about themselves.
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于态度推断题。第3段第1句指出：现实生活中的一些事件会决定梦境的内容，除此之外，在分析梦境之时，与此同等重要的是我们持有的先人为主的见解及看法。即选项C与此句相符。

 Passage Three
  Always at the beginning of any particular hunt there was one solemn ceremony to perform: an earnest consultation between all the hunters as to which spoor was most worthwhile following. The Bushmen would sit on their heels like elder statesmen discussing the size, mood, sex, and direction of the animals, study the wind, the sun, the hour and the weather generally. When they had picked out one particular spoor they revealed their decision by flicking their hands over it loosely from their wrists and making a sound like the wind between their teeth. They would do that, too, whenever spoor was fresh and promising and the gesture came so clearly from a background of meaning that we never saw it without an immediate quickening of our own pulses.
The decision made, they would set out at a steady trot, until there was evidence that their quarry was near. Sometimes they would stalk it, first on their knees and finally full on the stomach, until the animal came within range of their bows. Frequently, if seen, they would make no effort to hide themselves but go slowly, hands behind their backs, imitating the movements of ostriches pecking casually at the food in the veld. When hunting in a group they seemed to prefer shooting in pairs, coming up together on their knees like shadows within a bush. Without a word being spoken but by some process of wordless intercommunication of purpose, simultaneously they would let fly their arrow at the animal, the bowstrings resounding with a wild harp-like twang. That done they would stand up at leisure. They never expected the animal to drop dead at once, knowing they would have to wait until the poison began to do its deadly work.
But the first thing to establish was that the arrows had found their mark. The arrows were made in three sections for this very reason. First, the poisoned head was made in one short hollowed piece which fitted into another slightly larger one which was joined to the main shaft, notched at the far end to take the bow-string without slipping or fumbling. This made certain that the wounded animal would be unable to rid itself of the arrow by rubbing its wounded place against a tree, for in this way the arrow-shaft either parted from the arrow-head on impact, or else when the animal started rubbing itself against trunks and thorn bushes. If the hunters recovered the arrows intact, of course, they made no attempt to follow the alerted quarry. But if they found only the shaft they would take up the spoor at once and the real business of the hunt began. How long it took before they closed in for the kill with their spears on an animal already half paralyzed by poison, depended on the sort of poison used, the size of the animal, and the nature and place of the wound. Sometimes the chase would last only an hour or two, but with the greatest of all quarries, the eland, it sometimes took a whole day.
I have never seen a killing which seemed more innocent. It was killing in order to live. On their faces there was always an expression of profound relief and gratitude when the hunter's quest had been fulfilled. There was also a desire to complete the killing as quickly as possible. I have watched their faces many times while performing this deed and I could see only the strain of the hunt, the signs of fatigue from running all day under a cloudless sky in a high temperature, together with a kind of dedicated expression, but no gloating, or killing for the sake of killing.

1. According to the passage the hunters kill their prey by _______ .
A：following their spoor
B：shooting them with spears
C：trapping them
D：shooting them with poisoned arrows
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于事实细节题。由文章第三段“How long it took before they closed in for the kill with their spears on an animal already half paralyzed by poison,  depended on the sort of poison used，the size of the animal，and the nature and place of the wound”可知，猎人射杀猎物使用的是长矛。故答案为B。

2. What did the writer find it is exciting to see?
A：Animals being chased and killed.
B：The hunter's hand gestures signaling a target
C：The way the arrows are made.
D：The way hunters find their quarry.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文章首段最后一句提出：不论什么时候，只要足迹是刚刚留下的或者有捕到的希望，他们也会做出这种动作。如果我们在他们所处的背景下看到他们那种坚决、明了的手势，脉搏同样会加快跳动。题干中exciting与文中quickening of our own pulses是同义转换，文中令作者脉搏加速的原因是看到猎手们的手势。结合文章内容可知，这种动作是猎人在发现新的猎物足迹时所发出的，选项D与文章信息一致。故答案为D。

3. The writer considers the hunters as ______ .
A：sportsmen
B：humane killers
C：childlike savages
D：cunning ostrich impersonators
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于信息推断题。文中最后一段首句提及：“我”未曾见过比这更无罪的( innocent)杀戮，这是为了生存而进行的杀戮(killing in order to live)。本段最后一句也提及没有幸灾乐祸，或者只是为了杀戮而杀戮。由此可推知，作者并不认为猎人猎杀动物是残忍的，相反这是一种为了生存而进行的行为，选项中与文章意义最接近的是B：人道的猎杀者。故答案为B。

4. According to the passage, the hunters imitate ostriches because ______ .
A：they want to gain the trust of their intended prey
B：they would like to entertain each other after a hard day's work
C：ostriches are easier to imitate than elands
D：if seen they could hide their heads in the ground
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于事实细节题。由题干中的ostriches定位信息在第二段，段中提及：被猎物发现也是常有的事，这时他们也不会去努力隐藏自己，而是缓慢移动，双手放在背后，模仿草原上随意啄食的鸵鸟的动作。由此可知，猎人模仿鸵鸟的目的在于不引起猎物的注意，从而捕杀它们，选项A与文章信息一致，故答案为A。

5. If the hunters found only the shaft of an arrow, it meant most importantly ______ .
A：there was an animal dying somewhere
B：the arrow was well made
C：the arrow was badly made
D：they would never find arrow-head
正确答案：A
答案为A，信息推断题。由题干中的the shaft of an arrow定位信息在第三段。段中提及：若狩猎者找回来的箭是完好无损的（the arrow intact），当然没必要再去追踪已产生警觉的猎物。若找回来的只有箭杆( only the shaft)，他们会马上沿着足迹追踪，一场真正的狩猎活动就此开始。由此可推知，只剩下剑杆就说明猎物已经被射中，后文中也提及：被箭射伤并因中毒而处于半瘫痪的猎物。选项A与文章信息一致，故答案为A。

1. The main purpose of this text is to ________ .
A：inform the reader as to what causes the phenomenon of deja vu
B：weigh the validity of various theories regarding the basis of deja vu
C：present different theories that explain deja vu for the reader's consideration
D：argue that deja vu is a contentious issue through the listing of various opposing viewpoints
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于主旨思想题。文章第1段最后一句就是本文的中心：在这些“似曾经历”的感觉所代表的意义背后，存在着众多的理论。下文都是这些理论的介绍。故选项C正确。

2. In Paragraph 2, “...it is not a far stretch to believe that...“ is most similar in use to _______ .
A：it is sometimes believed that
B：the most likely conclusion is that
C：it logically follows that
D：it is not unreasonable to believe that
正确答案：A
答案为D．属于信息推断题。...it is not afar stretch to believe that...（词面意思：相信……并不需要太长的时间）在第2段第2句，前半句提到“那些相信轮回转世说这一理论的人，相信我们的灵魂会在死后于新的肉身上得到新生”，由此可推知“要他们相信在死亡及重生过程中，我们留存在记忆中的一些印象仍会保存在心灵之中也不应是什么难事”，即顺理成章。因此，选项D正确。

3. An example of ESP, as described in Paragraph 3, is _______ .
A：seeing through solid objects
B：sensing danger before it occurs
C：being able to communicate with animals
D：the ability to understand ideas and issues that most other humans cannot
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词ESP出现在第3段第1句，由ESP后面的逗号可判断后面的句子是它的同位语，是对它的进一步的解释：……“超感知觉”指的是超越我们正常的五种感觉……之外的那种感知事物的能力。第2句又补充道：对相信超感知觉的人来说，一个人“似曾见过”……并不是在过去生活中见到的，而是通过超感知觉以预感的形式看到的。由此可知，选项B正确。

4. In Paragraph 4, “...it has two records of it...“ is most similar in use to ______ .
A：it senses it as two memories of the same incident
B：it stores the information as memories of the same senses
C：it senses it as having occurred twice
D：it puts the two phenomena together into one memory
正确答案：A
答案为C，属于信息推断题。...it has two“records”of it...在第4段最后一句：因此，当大脑最终完成对感觉器官传递来的数据的评估时，就拥有这一数据的双份记录（一份是感觉器官的，另一份是大脑的），但两份记录同样真实。再结合本段第2句内容，不难推知，这种感觉就像事情发生了两次一样，故选项C正确。

5. The author views deja vu as ______ .
A：an issue that defies explanation, forcing one to rely on supposition
B：the phenomenon that is best answered by science
C：a contentious issue that is hard to resolve
D：a question with different answers based on whether one believes in religion, mysticism or science most strongly
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于态度推断题。文章第1段最后一句指出：有关“似曾经历”的感觉，存在着众多的理论；第2、3、4段分别介绍了三种不同的理论，由每段第1句中的信号词及第4段第1句便可判定，对于“似曾经历”这一现象，本文并无定论。由此可见，选项C正确。

Passage Two
  At 5:15 a m. of April 18, 1906, the greatest earthquake disaster in the history of the United States occurred. At that crucial moment, San Francisco and the surrounding area were rocked by huge movements in the earth underneath, causing previously unheard of damage above. The loss in money, lives and peace of mind were such that it took decades for San Francisco to recover, and still haunts the memory of that great city to this day .
As the first massive quake hit the sleeping city, buildings tumbled and chaos suddenly reigned in the streets. Amid bursting gas mains, falling debris and raging fires, panic held sway over the citizenry as each fled from the destruction all around them. People fled to the safety of parks, far from the toppling skyscrapers, as martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check.
Fire swept across the city as the broken gas mains caught fire and occasionally exploded. Brave firemen rushed to the scenes of disaster, only to find that the central water main had also been destroyed by the quake, leaving them helpless to watch as the fires raged on and spread further and further.
     A second massive shock hit the crumbled city at 8:00 a. m., nearly three hours after the first. Although the most serious fires began in the business district, as time progressed, it was clear that the loss in life was mainly suffered in the poorer areas of the city, under which most of the burning gas mains ran.  After all was said and done, the final death tolls were horrifyingly high. In addition, nearly all the major buildings in the city were reduced to rubble, including City Hall, the new Post Office, the Parrot Building ( previously the largest department store in the West) , the Chronicle and Examiner Buildings ( San Francisco's two major newspapers) , and Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto.
In the wake of the destruction, urban planners immediately set to work to rebuild the shattered city. They did this with gusto, designing new buildings, pipes and streets with earthquake safety in mind. These ongoing precautions no doubt contributed to the phenomenal performance of the city's infrastructure during the earthquake of 1989, in which, although millions of dollars in damage occurred, widespread major destruction and loss of life were avoided.

1. In Paragraph 2, the phrase “...martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check“ means ______.
A：without martial law, the madness would have been uncontrollable
B：martial law was the only means by which the madness could be controlled
C：martial law was the method chosen to control the madness
D：martial law succeeded in controlling the situation
正确答案：A
答案为C，属于信息推断题。...martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check在 第2段最后一句，由上下文得知：地震发生时，全城居民处于极度恐慌之中。后来人们纷纷远离倒塌的摩天大楼，逃往公园中的安全地带，这是由于军管法强令控制了老百姓中的恐慌现象。由此可知，选项C正确。

2. The mentioning of the various buildings destroyed implies that ______ .
A：almost all aspects of importance in the city suffered as a result of the earthquake
B：the major functions of the city could no longer be performed after the earthquake
C：the most major damage from the earthquake came in the form of those buildings listed
D：the damage caused by the earthquake was specific, but hit the most important areas in the city
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推断题。第4段最后一句：此外，几乎城中的所有主要建筑物都变成一堆瓦砾，市政厅、新邮局、鹦鹉大厦、《纪事报》及《审查者》大厦以及帕洛阿尔托附近的斯坦福大学都在劫难逃。文章拿这些城市重要的基础建筑举例无非是想说明这次地震造成的影响之大。因此，选项A正确。

3. Paragraph 5 suggests that _______ .
A：due to the precautions put in place after the 1906 earthquake, San Francisco is now safe from future earthquakes
B：although damage will probably occur in the next big earthquake in San Francisco, the precautions put in place after 1906 will ensure that none of the damage is major
C：the result of the 1906 earthquake was positive, because it allowed city planners to build a newer, more beautiful and safer city
D：although the 1906 earthquake was tragic, a positive result emerged in the form of increased safety that has already yielded benefits
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。相关内容在第5段最后一句：毫无疑问，不间断地执行这些预防措施也是这座城市的基础设施在1989年地震期间能够保存完好的主要原因，在那场地震中，尽管没能避免数百万美元的损失，但是并未发生大面积的重大破坏以及人员伤亡。由此可知，选项D正确。

4. The author mentions the situation of firemen in Paragraph 3 in order to _______ .
A：demonstrate that even those best equipped to handle the situation were at a loss
B：show that the situation was utterly hopeless
C：explain why the fire crews were unable to contain the damage caused by fire
D：give one example of a group of people that the earthquake particularly hurt
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词firemen出现在第3段第2句：英勇的消防员迅速赶到火灾现场，结果却发现中央供水管道也已经在地震中被毁坏，最后他们只能眼睁睁地看着火势肆虐，蔓延的范围越来越广。由此可推知，再勇敢的消防员即使配备先进的设备也会有无计可施的时候。因此，选项A正确。

5. The story of San Francisco’s reaction to the 1906 earthquake can best be described as ______ .
A：profound loss followed by stoic rebuilding
B：false confidence followed by a lesson learned
C：irretrievable loss followed by grief and mourning
D：a great city shattered and rebuilt, but never the same again
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于信息归纳题。题目问：下面哪个选项可以最恰当地描述1906年旧金山发生的地震？文章第1段是对这次地震的总体介绍；第2、3、4段描述了具体过程及所造成的损失；最后一段突出了旧金山城市重建工作的顺利展开及抗震决心。由此可知，选项A正确。

 Passage Three
  For several years, scientists have been testing a substance called interferon (干扰素), a potential wonder drug that is proving to be effective in treating a variety of ailments, including virus infections, bacteria infections, and tumors. To date, the new drug has provoked no negative reaction of sufficient significance to discourage its use. But in spite of its success, last year only one gram was produced in the entire world.
The reason for the scarcity lies in the structure of interferon. A species of specific protein, the interferon produced from one animal species cannot be used in treating another animal species.  In other words, to treat human beings, only interferon produced by human beings may be used. The drug is produced by infecting white blood cells with a virus. Fortunately, it is so powerful that the amount given each patient per injection is very small.
Unlike antibiotics, interferon does not attack germs directly. Instead, it makes unaffected cells resistant to infection, and prevents the multiplication of viruses within cells.
As you might conclude, one of the most dramatic uses of interferon has been in the treatment of cancer. Dr. Hans Strander, research physician at Sweden's famous Karolinska Institute, has treated more than one hundred cancer patients with the new drug. Among a group of selected patients who have undergone surgical procedures for advanced cancer, half were given interferon. The survival rate over a three-year period was 70 percent among those who were treated with interferon as compared with only 10 t030 percent among those who have received the conventional treatments.
In the United States, a large-scale project supported by the American Cancer Society is now underway. If the experiment is successful, interferon could become one of the greatest medical discoveries of our time.

1. In what does interferon differ from antibiotics?
A：Interferon has serious side effects, whereas antibiotics do not.
B：Interferon is available in large supply, whereas antibiotics are not
C：Antibiotics are very effective, while interferon is not.
D：Antibiotics kill germs by attacking them directly, while interferon does not.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文中第3段首句提及，与抗生素不同的是，干扰素不直 接攻击病菌。由此可知，答案为D。

2. What effect does interferon have on infection?
A：It provokes a negative reaction.
B：It keeps healthy cells from becoming infected.
C：It causes healthy cells to grow.
D：It attacks viruses.
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于事实细节题。文中第3段第2句提及，干扰素的作用是让未感染的细胞具有抗感染性。由此可知，答案为B。

3. Interferon is produced by _______ .
A：infecting viruses, bacteria, and tumors with a drug
B：infecting proteins with a virus
C：infecting white blood cells with a virus
D：infecting viruses with proteins
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于事实细节题。文中第2段倒数第2句提及，通过利用病毒感染白细胞产生该药物。由此可知，答案为C。

4. Interferon has not been widely used because it is ________ .
A：still very dangerous
B：being tested in the United States
C：difficult to produce in large quantities
D：not effective for human beings
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于信息推断题。文中最后一段提及该药在美国尚在试验之中，由此可推知，药品还没有大范围使用，故答案为B。

5. Which of the following is true of the results of Dr. Stander’s experiments?
A：Both interferon and conventional treatments should be used to ensure the survival of the patients.
B：At the end of three years, only ten to thirty percent of the patients who had not received interferon died.
C：Only the patients who received interferon survived.
D：Most of the patients who were treated with inferno survived.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文中第4段的末句提及使用干扰素的患者的存活率是70%，由此可知，使用干扰素治疗的大部分患者存活了，故答案为D。

  Passage Two
       Competitors complain that Microsoft's recent settlement of their antitrust case with the federal government will do little to protect them or consumers from the software giant's monopoly power. But they hold out hope that state attorney generals could make the deal more restrictive.  "My guess is that all Bill Gates could do was to suppress a big grin when he held his press conference this morning," said Mitchell Kertzman, chief executive of Liberate Technologies, a rival provider of software for interactive TV.  "This settlement doesn't come close to matching the scope of the violations of antitrust law that Microsoft has been convicted of," he added. "It was an inexplicably bad deal for the government. "
     Microsoft and the Justice Department presented the settlement to a federal judge this Friday, saying it would end the antitrust case in a way that would help the sagging economy. U. S.  District Judge Colleen Kollar Kotelly agreed to review it and gave the 18 states involved in the case until Tuesday to decide whether to accept the plan.
     Several competitors called on the state attorney generals to insist on making changes to the settlement. Sun Microsystems' general counsel, Michael Morris, said the Justice Department was walking away from a case they had already won. " Paul T. Cappuccio, the general counsel for AOL Time Warner, said the settlement "does too little to promote competition and protect consumers, and can too easily be evaded by a determined monopolist like Microsoft. "
The state attorney generals had been pressing for stiffer penalties, but on Friday, several said some progress had been made. Among the key elements of the settlement, Microsoft would have to:
  Help rivals make products compatible with the Windows operating system, which runs 91% of the world's computers.
  Stop using exclusive deals with computer sellers to put competitors at a disadvantage.
  Let three in-house, independent experts monitor its compliance.
    "We're quite disappointed. We believe that there are a lot of issues that haven't been addressed," said Michael Mace, chief officer of handheld computer maker Palm, "which makes an operating system that competes with one from Microsoft." Several tech executives said the settlement was too focused on restricting Microsoft's Windows monopoly, and not its broader business practices and non-PC initiatives.
"This is a reward, not a remedy. It fails to terminate the illegal monopoly and fails to unfetter the market from anticompetitive conduct," said Kelly Jo MacArthur, general counsel for Real Networks, which makes music and video software threatened by Windows Media Player. "This agreement allows a declared illegal monopolist to determine, at its sole discretion, what goes into the monopoly operating system in the future," she added.
 

1. We can infer from the text that the main issue behind Microsoft’s antitrust case is the need ____ .
A：to boost a sagging economy
B：to limit the reach of Microsoft's Windows operating system
C：to prevent Microsoft from monopolizing the computer industry
D：for Microsoft to assist its competitors in making products compatible with Windows
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。文章第1段第1句指出：竞争对手抱怨微软最近和联邦政府达成的反托拉斯案件的协议对保护他们和消费者免受这个软件巨人的垄断控制起不了什么作用。倒数第2段最后一句又补充道：数位技术管理人员说这个协议只着重于限制微软视窗的垄断，而没有考虑到更广泛的经营活动以及非个人计算机的创新业务。由此可知，选项 C正确。

2. The comment from Michael Morris (Para.3) implies that the Justice Department ______ .
A：had just wrapped up a successful case
B：missed a chance to more stringently regulate Microsoft
C：was leaving most of the work to the state attorney generals involved
D：had failed in their mission to protect business competition.
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词Michael Morris，Justice Department出现在第3段第2句：……迈克尔•莫里斯说，司法部“正从已经获得胜利的案件中脱身”。再结合其上下文分析可知，司法部错过了一个更加严格地约束微软的好机会。因此，选项B正确。

3. The fourth paragraph suggests that most of the state attorney generals _______ .
A：were under pressure from Microsoft's competitors to demand changes in the settlement
B：felt that the settlement was at least partially successful
C：felt the penalties against Microsoft were too harsh
D：believed that the settlement was a sign of progress for the computer industry
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。第4段第1句指出：国家首席检察官们一直在竭力要求实行更加严厉的处罚，而星期五，数位首席检察官说已经取得了进展。由此可知，他们认为这一案子至少已经取得了部分的成功，故选项B正确。

4. What provision of the settlement is meant to ensure its enforcement?
A：The review of a federal judge.
B：The review and approval by 18 state attorney generals.
C：The monitoring by independent experts installed at Microsoft.
D：The watchful eyes of Microsoft's numerous competitors.
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。协议的主要内容在第5、6、7段：帮助对手生产与世界上91%的计算机使用的视窗操作系统兼容的产品；停止与计算机销售商达成排他性的协议而使竞争对手处于不利的地位；允许三位进驻公司的独立专家监督协议的遵守情况。显然，最后一条是本题的答案，即选项C。

5. This text is mainly about _______ .
A：the role of the federal government in managing disputes in technology industry
B：Microsoft's settlement of the antitrust case with the federal government
C：Microsoft's monopoly over the computer industry
D：competitors' responses to Microsoft's antitrust settlement
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于主旨思想题。文章第1段第1句就指出“竞争对手对微软最近和联邦苻达成的反托拉斯案件的协议有怨言”。接下来的几段详细介绍了有关协议及其竞争对手对拘意见和反应。由此可见，本文重点讲述了竞争对手们对微软反托拉斯案件达成的协议的立，即选项D正确。

 Passage Three
  What do the consumers really want? That's a question market researchers would love to answer. But since people don't always say what they think, marketers would need direct access to consumers' thoughts to get the truth.
     Now, in a way, that is possible. At the "Mind of the Market" laboratory at Harvard Business School, researchers are looking inside shoppers' skulls to develop more effective advertisements and marketing pitches. Using imaging techniques that measure the blood flow to various parts of the brain, the Harvard team hopes to predict how consumers will react to particular products and to discover the most effective ways to present information. Stephen Kosslyn, a professor of psychology at Harvard, and Business School professor Cerald Zaltman, oversee the lab. The goal is not to manipulate people's preference," says Kosslyn, "just to speak to their actual desires."  The group's finding, though still preliminary, could radically change how firms develop and market new products.
The Harvard group use position emission topography (PET) scans to monitor the brain activity. These PET scans, along with other non-invasive imaging techniques, enable researchers to see which parts of the brain are active during specific tasks (such as remembering a word).  Correlations have been found between blood flow to specific areas and future behavior. Because of this, Harvard researchers believe the scans can also predict future purchasing patterns. According to an unpublished paper the group produced, "It's possible to use these techniques to predict not only whether people will remember and have specific emotional reactions to certain materials, but also whether they will be inclined to want those materials months later."
The Harvard group is now moving into the next stage of experiments. They will explore how people remember advertisements as part of an effort to predict how they will react to a product after having seen an ad. The researchers believe that once key areas of the brain identified, scans on about two dozen volunteers will be enough to draw conclusions about the reactions of specific segments of the population. Large corporations-including Coca Cola, Eastman Kodak, General Motors, and Hallmark-have already signed up to fund further investigations.
For their financial support, these firms gain access to the experiments but cannot control them. If Kosslyn and Zaltman and their team really can read the mind of the market, the consumers may find it even harder to get those advertising jingles out of their heads.
   

1. Which of the following statements can be the best title for this passage?
A：Reading the Mind of the Market
B：Controlling the Consumers' Preference
C：Improving the Styles of Advertising
D：Finding Out the Way to Predict
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于主旨思想题。参照文章第2段中“Mind of the Market”laboratory和尾段的If Kosslyn and Zaltman and their team really can read the mind of the market可以推断出选项A正确答案。

2. Why do the Harvard researchers use scientific technology in the experiments?
A：Because they don't believe the surveys done by the marketers can lead to the truth.
B：Because they are asked by the marketers to find a direct way to read the consumers' thoughts.
C：Because they want to find out how the ads influence people's brain activity, emotional responses, etc.
D：Because they expect that their experiments can basically alter the marketing strategies of product.
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推理题。文中第2段第4句提及该实验的目的不是操纵人们的喜，而是要对顾客的实际需求做出反应。由此判断，选项C为正确答案。

3. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?
A：Sometimes people will conceal what they think when being questioned by the market researchers.
B：Stephen Kosslyn and Gerald Zaltman overlook the experiments and criticize the purpose of the study.
C：Harvard researchers have found the corresponding relations between people's brain and behavior.
D：There are many large organizations endorsing and financing the Harvard group's further investigation.
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于是非判断题。文中第2段第4句话提及“oversee”，而不是选项B中的 overlook”，由此判断，选项B正确。

4. What does “to speak to“ in the fifth sentence of the second paragraph mean?
A：to talk to
B：to say to
C：to communicate to
D：to respond to
正确答案：D
答案为D．属于词义推断题。提出的关键词speak to出现在第2段第4句话：“The goal not to manipulate people's preference,”says Kosslyn,“just to speak to their actual desires.”本句意思为，实验的目的不是操纵人们的喜好，而是要对顾客的实际需求做出反应。故选项D正确答案。

5. The last sentence of this passage implies that _______.
A：if the experiments' results can be applied to the practice, the customers will be likely to buy things according to the ads
B：if the Harvard group can succeed in finishing the research they will use it in attracting more and more consumers into the market
C：the financial supporting corporations such as Coca Cola, General Motors can employ the experiments in their own marketing
D：the consumers may discover that those ads will always annoy them by jingling out of their heads and cause them headaches
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推理题。文中第4段首句提到，哈佛的研究团队正在进行新一轮试验，即：研究人们如何记住产品广告，并借此来预测人们看到一个广告后，对该产品反如何。由此推理，选项A正确。

 Passage Two
  For centuries in Spain and Latin America, heading home for lunch and a snooze with the family was something like a national right, but with global capitalism standardizing work hours, this idyllic habit is fast becoming an endangered pleasure.  Ironically, all this is happening just as researchers are beginning to note the health benefits of the mid-afternoon nap.
According to a nationwide survey, less than 25 percent of Spaniards still enjoy siestas. And like Spain, much of Latin America has adopted Americanized work schedules, too, with shortened lunch time and more rigid work hours.  Last year the Mexican government passed a law limiting lunch breaks to one hour and requiring its employees to work their eight-hour shift between 7 a. m.  and 6 p. m. Before the mandate, workers would break up the shift-going home midday for a long break with the family and returning to work until about 90r 10 p. m. The idea of siesta is changing in Greece, Italy and Portugal, too, as they rush to join their more "industrious" counterparts in the global market.
Most Americans I know covet sleep, but the idea of taking a nap mid-afternoon equates with laziness, unemployment and general sneakiness. Yet according to a National Sleep Survey poll, 65 percent of adults do not get enough sleep. Numerous scientific studies document the benefits of nap taking, including one I997 study on the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation in the journal Internal Medicine. The researchers found that fatigue harms not only marital and social relations but worker productivity.
According to Mark Rosekind, a former NASA scientist and founder of Alertness Solutions in Cupertino, Calif.,  which educates busine96es about the advantages of sanctioning naps,  we're biologically programmed to get sleepy between 3 and 5 p.m. and 3 and 5 a.m. Our internal timekeeper - called the circadian clock-operates on a 24-hour rotation and every 12 hours there's a dip.  In accordance with these natural sleep rhythms, Rosekind recommends that naps be either for 40 minutes or for two hours. Latin American countries, asserts Rosekind, have had it right all along. They've been in sync with their clocks; we haven't.
Since most of the world is sleep-deprived, getting well under the recommended eight hours a night( adults get an average of 6.5 hours nightly) , we usually operate on a kind of idle midday.  Naps are even more useful now that most of us forfeit sleep because of insane work schedules, longer commute times and stress. In a study published last April, Brazilian medical researchers noted that blood pressure and arterial blood pressure dropped during a siesta.

1. In the second sentence of Paragraph l, “all this“ refers to ______.
A：the habit of napping
B：the standardizing of work hours
C：the decline of the siesta tradition
D：the growth of global capitalism
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于指代关系题。分析上下文可知，all this指的是上文中的this idyllic habit is fast becoming an endangered pleasure。因此，选项C正确。

2. We can infer from the second paragraph that Mexican workers now ______ .
A：work fewer hours than in the past
B：get home from work much later than in the past
C：work more reasonable hours than in the past
D：finish the workday earlier than in the past
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词Mexican workers出现在本段第3、4句：去年墨西哥政府通过一条法律，把午休时间缩短为1小时，并要求员工从上午7点到下午6点之间完成8小时的工作。此前，工人们中午暂时停止工作，回家同家人一起休息很长一段时间，然后再回去工作直到晚上九、十点钟左右。由此不难推出选项D项正确。

3. The word “covet“ in Paragraph 3 most likely means _______ .
A：need
B：desire
C：lack
D：value
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于词义推断题。根据第3段第1句可知：我认识的大多数美国人都 covet sleep，但是睡午觉的想法就等同于懒惰、失业以及总要偷偷摸摸。关联词but的使用表明后面的内容与前文意思的转折。由此可知，大多数美国人都渴望睡眠，故正确答案为 B项。

4. The author suggests that most Americans feel that _______ .
A：Spanish culture is inefficient
B：nap-taking will put their jobs at risk
C：nap-taking is a sign of laziness
D：they get plenty of sleep
正确答案：A
答案为C，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词most Americans出现在第3段第1句（见上题译文）。由此不难推知选项C的内容正确。

5. This text is mainly about _______ .
A：the health benefits of afternoon naps
B：the negative effects of sleep-deprivation on health and worker productivity
C：the importance of the siesta tradition in Spain and Latin America
D：the siesta tradition and its health benefits
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于主旨思想题。从文章内容来看，不但涉及了午睡的种种好处，而且还讲述了有关的发展历史和传统，因此能概括出这两方面内容的只有选项D。

 Passage Three
  There are a number of formats for reporting research, such as articles to appear in journals, reports addressed to funding agencies, theses or dissertations as part of the requirements for university degrees, and papers to be presented at conferences. These formats differ from one another mostly in their purposes and the audiences whom they address. We will now briefly describe them.
The journal article is a way of reporting research for professional journals or edited collections. The research is reporting in a brief, yet informative way, focusing mostly on the main features of the research such as the purpose, review of the literature ( often referred to as " background" ) , procedures used for carrying out the research accompanied by tables, charts, and graphs, and interpretations of the results (often referred to as discussion) .
The content and emphasis of the journal article will vary according to the intended readers (researchers or practitioners) and it is important for the researchers to be aware of the background and interest of the readers of the journal. Articles intended to be read by practitioners will emphasize the practical implications and recommendations of the research, while articles intended to be read by researchers will describe in detail the method used to collect data, the construction of data collection procedures, and the techniques used for analyzing the data. It is important for the novice researchers to be aware of the fact that articles submitted to journals go through a process of evaluation by experts who make a judgment and recommend whether they should be published or not.
The thesis or dissertation is a format for reporting research which graduate students write as part of fulfilling the requirements for an advanced academic degree. The student is expected to describe in great detail all the phases of the research so it can be examined and evaluated carefully by the reader. Thus the thesis or dissertation includes the purpose and significance of the study, the rationale, a thorough review of the literature, detailed information as to the research tools and the procedures involved in their development, a description of data analysis and the results, and an interpretation of the results in the form of conclusions, implications, and recommendation. This detailed description of the process of the research is needed to provide the professors with an indication of the student's ability to carry out research.
The conference paper is a way of reporting research at conferences, seminars and colloquia.  At such meetings research papers are usually presented orally. They are similar to the research article since research is reported in a concise, yet informative way, focusing on the most essential elements of the research. Handouts and transparencies can also accompany the presentations. As with the research article, here too, the audience present at the meeting, and whether they are researchers or practitioners.

1. The best title for this passage could be _______ .
A：Types of Research Reports
B：Types of Journal Articles
C：Writing of Research Reports
D：Writing of Different Articles
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于主旨思想题。分析可知，本文在第1段提出了文章的主要内容，为研究报告的不同形式。因此，选项A正确。

2. The common aspect for the journal articles, theses and conference papers lies in that ______.
A：they are all for the practitioners
B：they are all to be read by researchers
C：they are all for being published
D：they are all forms of reporting research
正确答案：D
Key:  答案为D，属于事实细节题。文章首段的第1句话是答案的出处，故答案为D。

3. We can distinguish those research reports from each other mainly through ______.
A：their writing style and length
B：their aims and possible audiences
C：their presented places and time
D：their content and purposes
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于事实细节题。文章首段的末句提及这些形式的目的和读者大都不同，由此可知，答案为B。

4. Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned in this passage?
A：Both journal articles and conference papers are reported in a brief and informative way.
B：All the theses or dissertations and conference papers are reported in spoken languages.
C：Both the journal articles and conference papers are influenced greatly by the intended receivers.
D：The various formats of research reports may be presented in different ways.
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于是非判断题。第2段“The research is reporting in a brief，yet informative way…”和第5段“They are similar to the research article...elements of the research.”是答案A的依据；第3段提及“Articles intended to be read by practitioners... for analyzing the data.”是选项C的依据；第4段“The thesis or dissertation is a format for... advanced academic degree.”和第5段“At such meetings research papers are usually presented orally.”提及报告有书面形式，也有口头形式。由此可知，D项也在文中提及。故答案为B。

5. How can a professor evaluate a student’s capability of implementing the research?
A：By concentrating on the main factors like the purpose, background, procedures and discussion.
B：By emphasizing the practical implications and recommendations of the research.
C：By focusing on the detailed description of the process of the research such as the tools, procedures, process of data analysis, results, conclusions, etc.
D：By noticing the detailed method used to collect the data, the construction of the data collection procedures, the techniques for analyzing the data, results, etc.
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于事实细节题。从文章最后一段的第2句、第3句和第4句可知答案为C。

 Passage Two
  The use of chemicals in almost all areas of life has become a commonplace phenomenon. There is growing evidence, however, that chemicals in the environment, including pesticides, may contribute to some illnesses. While studies are still being conducted, preliminary conclusions point to the verdict that such chemicals are indeed negatively impacting those humans to whom they are exposed.
Children are especially vulnerable to toxic substances. Pound for pound, they eat, drink and breathe more than adults, all of which exposes them more heavily to those chemicals to which most individuals encounter on a daily basis. Furthermore, their bodies are still in developing stages, exacerbating the negative effects of those chemicals which negatively impact them.
Of 50 types of pesticides commonly used in American schools, a study conducted by the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides found that many caused negative reactions in laboratory animals. Such negative effects included kidney and liver damage, cancer and neurological and reproductive problems.
These implications of these findings are far-reaching. Given the variety of harmful effects attributed to those pesticides tested, one must pause and consider whether it is wise to continue their use in the nation's schools, where children will be constantly exposed to them. Activists have lobbied for the elimination of such use with a degree of success, and recent findings, if supported by further analysis and confirmation, may help further the cause. A long term solution or alternative, however, remains elusive.
In the short run, however, there may be some measures that can be taken to mitigate the harmful effects of dangerous pesticides. The American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs concluded in a 1997 report that given the "particular uncertainty...regarding the long-term health effects of low-dose pesticide exposures" , it is " prudent" for adults and children to limit their exposure and to " consider the use of the least toxic chemical pesticides or non-chemical alternatives".
 

1. The citing of dangerous effects of pesticides on laboratory animals in Paragraph 3 is used to suggest that _______ .
A：scientists are also concerned with the effects of pesticides on animals
B：cancer is the worst effect of the pesticides
C：all the dangerous effects of pesticides are now known
D：the chemicals may also cause these effects in humans
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。第3段说明很多杀虫剂会给动物带来诸多不良反应。第4段第1、2句说明这一研究的意义：这些研究结果意义深远。考虑到各种的副作用，人们必然会思考这样一个问题：由于孩子们将与这些有害物质有长时间的连续接触，那么在学校里继续使用这些杀虫剂是不是明智之举？由此可推知，选项D正确。

2. Children are more likely to suffer the negative effects of pesticides than adults because _____ .
A：children absorb more pesticides than adults
B：pesticides are used more in areas with children
C：the pesticides used in schools are more dangerous
D：adults know more about pesticides than children
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于事实细节题。相关信息在第2段第2句：同样是1磅的东西，孩子们吃的、喝的以及呼吸的气体都要多于成年人，所有这一切使得他们受到那些大多数人每天都要接触的化学制品的负面影响更严重。由此可知，选项A符合句意。

3. The main point of this text is that ______ .
A：pesticides are dangerous and their uses need to be reevaluated
B：children suffer most from the effects of pesticides
C：schools are most responsible for pesticide-related illnesses
D：pesticides should be eliminated everywhere
正确答案：A
属于主旨思想题。文章第1段第2句以however引出真正的主题：然而，愈来愈多的证据表明包括杀虫剂在内的化学品暴露在环境中会导致一些疾病的发生。接下来的几段介绍了其具体的负面影响、有关研究结果及解决办法等。最后一段总结上文，强调指出：鉴于接触低剂量杀虫剂会给长期健康带来副作用……无论成人还是小孩都需谨慎，尽量减少与有害化学制品的接触，并且考虑使用含有尽可能少的有害物质的化学杀虫剂，或者使用不含化学成分的其他杀虫剂代用品。由此可见，选项A正确。

4. The author mentions the exaggerated effects of chemicals on children in Paragraph 2 to ____ .
A：prove that pesticides are dangerous to all humans
B：show that children are more susceptible to many kinds of dangers
C：suggest a solution to the problem of pesticides
D：identify one group that pesticides hurt in particular
正确答案：A
答案为D，属于信息推断题。第2段第1句指出：孩子们尤其易受有毒物质的侵蚀。接下来的句子和段落都围绕着孩子和学校说明接触和使用杀虫剂的种种害处，进而提出忠告和解决办法。可见，孩子在文中只是作为一组受到杀虫剂影响的特殊研究对象。因此，选项D正确。

5. The author cites the American Medical Association’s advice in Paragraph 5 to _____ .
A：present more factual details to clarify the issue
B：present an alternative theory for consideration
C：present a recommendation from a reputable source
D：present a solution drawn from all the evidence considered
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推断题。American Medical Association的建议出现在第5段第2句（译文参见第8题），从用词regarding，prudent，consider来看，显然这只是提供一个较权威的建议，因此，选项C正确。

 Passage Three
  From the health point of view we are living in a marvelous age. We are immunized from birth against many of the most dangerous diseases.  A large number of once fatal illnesses can now be cured by modern drugs and surgery. It is almost certain that one day remedies will be found for the most stubborn remaining diseases. The expectation of life has increased enormously. But though the possibility of living a long and happy life is greater than ever before, every day we witness the incredible slaughter of them, women and children on the roads, man versus the motor-car! It is a never-ending battle in which man is losing. Thousands of people the world over are killed or horribly killed each year and we are quietly sitting back and letting it happen. It has been rightly said that when a man is sitting behind a steering wheel, his car becomes the extension of his personality. There is no doubt that the motor-car often brings out a man's very worst qualities. People who are normally quiet and pleasant may become unrecognizable when they are behind a steering wheel. They swear, they are ill-mannered and aggressive, willful as two-year-olds and utterly selfish. All their hidden frustrations, disappointments and jealousies seem to be brought to the surface by the act of driving.
The surprising thing is that the society smiles so gently on the motorist and seems to forgive his behavior. Everything is done for his convenience. Cities are allowed to become almost uninhabitable because of heavy traffic; towns are made ugly by huge car parks; the countryside is desecrated by road networks; and the mass annual slaughter becomes nothing more than a statistic, to be conveniently forgotten. It is high time a world code were created to reduce this senseless waste of human life. With regard to driving, the laws of some countries are notoriously lax and even the strictest are not strict enough.
     A code which was universally accepted could only have a dramatically beneficial effect on the accident rate. Here are a few examples of some of the things that might be done. The driving test should be standardized and made far more difficult than it is; all the drivers should be made to take a test every three years or so; the age at which young people are allowed to drive any vehicle should be raised to at least 21; all vehicles should be put through strict annual tests for safety.  Even the smallest amount of alcohol in the blood can impair a person's driving ability. Present drinking and driving laws (where they exist) should be made much stricter. Maximum and minimum speed limits should be imposed on all roads.
Governments should lay down safety specifications for manufacturers, as has been done in the USA. All advertising stressing power and performance should be banned. These measures may sound inordinately harsh.  But surely nothing should be considered as too severe if it results in reducing the annual toll of human life. After all, the world is for human beings, not for motor-cars.

1. The main idea of this passage is _______.
A：traffic accidents are mainly caused by motorists
B：thousands of people the world over are killed each year
C：the laws of some countries about driving are too lax
D：only stricter traffic laws can prevent accidents
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于主旨思想题。分析可知，文章的中心思想为严格的交通法规才能对事故起到预防作用，故答案为D。

2. What does the author think of society toward motorists?
A：Society criticizes the motorists severely.
B：Huge car parks are built in the cities and towns.
C：Society overlooks their rude driving.
D：Victims of accidents are nothing.
正确答案：C
答案为C．属于信息推断题。文中第2段首句提及社会对于汽车司机过于温和，宽恕他们造成的诸多不便，由此可推知，答案为C。

3. Why does the author say “his car becomes the extension of his personality“?
A：Driving can show his real self.
B：Driving can show part of his personality.
C：Driving can bring out his character.
D：His car embodies his temper.
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于信息推断题。题干中提及的句子在第1段中。在本段的最后3句中提及，汽车经常会呈现人品质中坏的一面，并列举一系列的坏品质，由此可推知，答案为A。

4. Which of the followings is NOT mentioned as a way to against traffic accidents?
A：Build more highways.
B：Stricter driving tests.
C：Test drivers every three years.
D：Raise age limit and lay down safety specifications.
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于是非判断题。在文中第4段提及了一些减少事故的措施，B、C、D都明确提到，而A选项“要修更多的路”并没有提及，故答案为A。

5. The attitude of the author is _______ .
A：ironical
B：critical
C：appealing
D：militant
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于态度推断题。文中第2段末句提及对于驾驶，很多国家的法律太轻，甚至最严厉的法规也不够严厉。最后一段呼吁各国制定严格的交通法则，由此可推知，答案为B。

Passage Two
  Dreams are said to be the window to the mind. Through the study of dreams, we can catch glimpses into what our subconscious minds are thinking, or what is troubling us at our deepest levels. Not all dreams are the same, however, either in content or in meaning. In this respect, the study of bad dreams, nightmares, can yield interesting observations in regard to the mind and status of the dreamer. Indeed, nightmares appear to have been the subject of far more studies than more pleasant dreams, if for no other reason that while pleasant dreams are easily forgotten upon awakening, nightmares tend to linger in our minds is sufficient to demand attention.
The sources of our dreams are most commonly attributed to factors in our waking lives. Whether it be emotional challenges, stress in the workplace, relationship problems or a myriad of other possible factors, the thoughts and feelings created in our waking environments are believed to directly influence the content of our dreams. A particular dramatic or traumatic experience during the day would no doubt be encountered again in some form or another during the night.
Just as important as actual events in the determination of the content of our dreams are the pre- existing beliefs that we hold.  If we encounter some kind of phenomena m our dreams, it is very likely that we already believed in the possibility of the phenomena before the dream. For example, if someone dreams of being abducted by aliens, it's very likely that, before the dream, he already believed in the existence of aliens. To the extent that dreams are direct reflections of our minds, they will reflect accurately what we believe and hold to be true.
    The way that we act in dreams bears consideration as well. Oftentimes, our behavior in our dreams reflects hidden desires for that type of behavior in our waking lives. Someone who dreams of revenge may actually desire revenge in real life, and likewise someone who dreams of adventure night after night may be experiencing his mind playing out a desire for more excitement in his everyday life.
While the items encountered in our dreams are of great importance in the analysis of dreams, it must be recognized and understood that the same item in two different dreams can easily have entirely different meanings for the two dreamers. For example, a horse in the dreams of an avid equestrian can signify comfort and relaxation, whereas the same horse in the dreams of a hunter can represent excitement and challenge.

1. Nightmares are mentioned in Paragraph 1 in order to _______ .
A：pay attention to the main subject of the text
B：give an example of one particularly vivid type of dream
C：provide a justification for the study of dreams
D：illustrate the value of analyzing dreams
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。由第1段第4句可知：在这一点上，关于噩梦或噩梦的研究可以得出很多有关做梦者的内心及其状况的有趣见解。下文对噩梦和好梦进行了对比，说明噩梦一直以来是更多研究中的主题，因为它不容易被人忘却。由此可知，选项B正确。

2. Based on the information provided in Paragraph 3, if a man dreamed of being hit by a train, it is likely that he ______ .
A：has been hit by a train before
B：believes in the existence of trains
C：believes that it is possible for him to be hit by a train
D：is afraid of being hit by a train
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于信息推断题。第3段第2句指出：如果我们梦见某种现象，那么很可能在此之前我们就相信了这种现象是有可能存在的。据此，我们可推断：如果一个人梦见被火车撞了，那么很可能他早就相信了有这种可能性的存在，即选项C正确。

3. The last sentence of the text gives an example of horses encountered in dreams of two different people in order to ______ .
A：illustrate how the same item can mean different things in different dreams
B：exemplify the concept that people react differently to the same images in dreams
C：illustrate the idea that the emotions and feelings of different dreamers can be manifested in their respective dreams in similar images
D：support the assertion that the meaning behind dream images is entirely subjective
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于信息推断题。文章最后一句给出的例子的目的就是for example的上文，即本段的第1句：尽管人们梦境中所遇到的事物对分析梦境起着至关重要的作用，但我们必须承认、也必须理解，同一件物品出现在两个不同的梦中对于两位做梦者而言可以代表完全不同的意义。因此，选项A正确。

4. The main point of the text is that _______ .
A：the study of dreams is based on logic from the waking life of the dreamer
B：in order to understand the meaning of dreams, we must analyze the lives of the dreamers
C：dreams can reveal much about the personality of a dreamer
D：the study of dreams, while multi-faceted, is a worthwhile endeavor
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于主旨思想题。第1段指出“梦境是心灵之窗”；第2段分析了“梦境的渊源常可追溯到我们清醒之时经历的一些事情”；第3段指出“……在分析梦境之时，与此同等重要的是我们持有的先人为主的见解及看法”；第4段指出“梦境中的行为举止同样也引发人的思考”；最后一段“……必须承认和理解，同一件物品出现在两个不同的梦中可代表完全不同的意义”。由此可知，选项A正确。

5. The author would most likely agree with the following sentence: ________ .
A：Dreams can be a useful tool in looking into the deeply held beliefs and emotions of the dreamer.
B：Those who study dreams must first study the environment of the dreamer.
C：The study of dreams makes sense if we know what to look for.
D：Dreamers should pay attention to their dreams to discern what those dreams reveal about themselves.
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于态度推断题。第3段第1句指出：现实生活中的一些事件会决定梦境的内容，除此之外，在分析梦境之时，与此同等重要的是我们持有的先人为主的见解及看法。即选项C与此句相符。

 Passage Three
  Always at the beginning of any particular hunt there was one solemn ceremony to perform: an earnest consultation between all the hunters as to which spoor was most worthwhile following. The Bushmen would sit on their heels like elder statesmen discussing the size, mood, sex, and direction of the animals, study the wind, the sun, the hour and the weather generally. When they had picked out one particular spoor they revealed their decision by flicking their hands over it loosely from their wrists and making a sound like the wind between their teeth. They would do that, too, whenever spoor was fresh and promising and the gesture came so clearly from a background of meaning that we never saw it without an immediate quickening of our own pulses.
The decision made, they would set out at a steady trot, until there was evidence that their quarry was near. Sometimes they would stalk it, first on their knees and finally full on the stomach, until the animal came within range of their bows. Frequently, if seen, they would make no effort to hide themselves but go slowly, hands behind their backs, imitating the movements of ostriches pecking casually at the food in the veld. When hunting in a group they seemed to prefer shooting in pairs, coming up together on their knees like shadows within a bush. Without a word being spoken but by some process of wordless intercommunication of purpose, simultaneously they would let fly their arrow at the animal, the bowstrings resounding with a wild harp-like twang. That done they would stand up at leisure. They never expected the animal to drop dead at once, knowing they would have to wait until the poison began to do its deadly work.
But the first thing to establish was that the arrows had found their mark. The arrows were made in three sections for this very reason. First, the poisoned head was made in one short hollowed piece which fitted into another slightly larger one which was joined to the main shaft, notched at the far end to take the bow-string without slipping or fumbling. This made certain that the wounded animal would be unable to rid itself of the arrow by rubbing its wounded place against a tree, for in this way the arrow-shaft either parted from the arrow-head on impact, or else when the animal started rubbing itself against trunks and thorn bushes. If the hunters recovered the arrows intact, of course, they made no attempt to follow the alerted quarry. But if they found only the shaft they would take up the spoor at once and the real business of the hunt began. How long it took before they closed in for the kill with their spears on an animal already half paralyzed by poison, depended on the sort of poison used, the size of the animal, and the nature and place of the wound. Sometimes the chase would last only an hour or two, but with the greatest of all quarries, the eland, it sometimes took a whole day.
I have never seen a killing which seemed more innocent. It was killing in order to live. On their faces there was always an expression of profound relief and gratitude when the hunter's quest had been fulfilled. There was also a desire to complete the killing as quickly as possible. I have watched their faces many times while performing this deed and I could see only the strain of the hunt, the signs of fatigue from running all day under a cloudless sky in a high temperature, together with a kind of dedicated expression, but no gloating, or killing for the sake of killing.

1. According to the passage the hunters kill their prey by _______ .
A：following their spoor
B：shooting them with spears
C：trapping them
D：shooting them with poisoned arrows
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于事实细节题。由文章第三段“How long it took before they closed in for the kill with their spears on an animal already half paralyzed by poison,  depended on the sort of poison used，the size of the animal，and the nature and place of the wound”可知，猎人射杀猎物使用的是长矛。故答案为B。

2. What did the writer find it is exciting to see?
A：Animals being chased and killed.
B：The hunter's hand gestures signaling a target
C：The way the arrows are made.
D：The way hunters find their quarry.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文章首段最后一句提出：不论什么时候，只要足迹是刚刚留下的或者有捕到的希望，他们也会做出这种动作。如果我们在他们所处的背景下看到他们那种坚决、明了的手势，脉搏同样会加快跳动。题干中exciting与文中quickening of our own pulses是同义转换，文中令作者脉搏加速的原因是看到猎手们的手势。结合文章内容可知，这种动作是猎人在发现新的猎物足迹时所发出的，选项D与文章信息一致。故答案为D。

3. The writer considers the hunters as ______ .
A：sportsmen
B：humane killers
C：childlike savages
D：cunning ostrich impersonators
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于信息推断题。文中最后一段首句提及：“我”未曾见过比这更无罪的( innocent)杀戮，这是为了生存而进行的杀戮(killing in order to live)。本段最后一句也提及没有幸灾乐祸，或者只是为了杀戮而杀戮。由此可推知，作者并不认为猎人猎杀动物是残忍的，相反这是一种为了生存而进行的行为，选项中与文章意义最接近的是B：人道的猎杀者。故答案为B。

4. According to the passage, the hunters imitate ostriches because ______ .
A：they want to gain the trust of their intended prey
B：they would like to entertain each other after a hard day's work
C：ostriches are easier to imitate than elands
D：if seen they could hide their heads in the ground
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于事实细节题。由题干中的ostriches定位信息在第二段，段中提及：被猎物发现也是常有的事，这时他们也不会去努力隐藏自己，而是缓慢移动，双手放在背后，模仿草原上随意啄食的鸵鸟的动作。由此可知，猎人模仿鸵鸟的目的在于不引起猎物的注意，从而捕杀它们，选项A与文章信息一致，故答案为A。

5. If the hunters found only the shaft of an arrow, it meant most importantly ______ .
A：there was an animal dying somewhere
B：the arrow was well made
C：the arrow was badly made
D：they would never find arrow-head
正确答案：A
答案为A，信息推断题。由题干中的the shaft of an arrow定位信息在第三段。段中提及：若狩猎者找回来的箭是完好无损的（the arrow intact），当然没必要再去追踪已产生警觉的猎物。若找回来的只有箭杆( only the shaft)，他们会马上沿着足迹追踪，一场真正的狩猎活动就此开始。由此可推知，只剩下剑杆就说明猎物已经被射中，后文中也提及：被箭射伤并因中毒而处于半瘫痪的猎物。选项A与文章信息一致，故答案为A。

正确答案：A
答案为D．属于信息推断题。...it is not afar stretch to believe that...（词面意思：相信……并不需要太长的时间）在第2段第2句，前半句提到“那些相信轮回转世说这一理论的人，相信我们的灵魂会在死后于新的肉身上得到新生”，由此可推知“要他们相信在死亡及重生过程中，我们留存在记忆中的一些印象仍会保存在心灵之中也不应是什么难事”，即顺理成章。因此，选项D正确。

3. An example of ESP, as described in Paragraph 3, is _______ .
A：seeing through solid objects
B：sensing danger before it occurs
C：being able to communicate with animals
D：the ability to understand ideas and issues that most other humans cannot
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词ESP出现在第3段第1句，由ESP后面的逗号可判断后面的句子是它的同位语，是对它的进一步的解释：……“超感知觉”指的是超越我们正常的五种感觉……之外的那种感知事物的能力。第2句又补充道：对相信超感知觉的人来说，一个人“似曾见过”……并不是在过去生活中见到的，而是通过超感知觉以预感的形式看到的。由此可知，选项B正确。

A：it senses it as two memories of the same incident
B：it stores the information as memories of the same senses
C：it senses it as having occurred twice
D：it puts the two phenomena together into one memory
正确答案：A
答案为C，属于信息推断题。...it has two“records”of it...在第4段最后一句：因此，当大脑最终完成对感觉器官传递来的数据的评估时，就拥有这一数据的双份记录（一份是感觉器官的，另一份是大脑的），但两份记录同样真实。再结合本段第2句内容，不难推知，这种感觉就像事情发生了两次一样，故选项C正确。

5. The author views deja vu as ______ .
A：an issue that defies explanation, forcing one to rely on supposition
B：the phenomenon that is best answered by science
C：a contentious issue that is hard to resolve
D：a question with different answers based on whether one believes in religion, mysticism or science most strongly
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于态度推断题。文章第1段最后一句指出：有关“似曾经历”的感觉，存在着众多的理论；第2、3、4段分别介绍了三种不同的理论，由每段第1句中的信号词及第4段第1句便可判定，对于“似曾经历”这一现象，本文并无定论。由此可见，选项C正确。

Passage Two
  At 5:15 a m. of April 18, 1906, the greatest earthquake disaster in the history of the United States occurred. At that crucial moment, San Francisco and the surrounding area were rocked by huge movements in the earth underneath, causing previously unheard of damage above. The loss in money, lives and peace of mind were such that it took decades for San Francisco to recover, and still haunts the memory of that great city to this day .
As the first massive quake hit the sleeping city, buildings tumbled and chaos suddenly reigned in the streets. Amid bursting gas mains, falling debris and raging fires, panic held sway over the citizenry as each fled from the destruction all around them. People fled to the safety of parks, far from the toppling skyscrapers, as martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check.
Fire swept across the city as the broken gas mains caught fire and occasionally exploded. Brave firemen rushed to the scenes of disaster, only to find that the central water main had also been destroyed by the quake, leaving them helpless to watch as the fires raged on and spread further and further.
     A second massive shock hit the crumbled city at 8:00 a. m., nearly three hours after the first. Although the most serious fires began in the business district, as time progressed, it was clear that the loss in life was mainly suffered in the poorer areas of the city, under which most of the burning gas mains ran.  After all was said and done, the final death tolls were horrifyingly high. In addition, nearly all the major buildings in the city were reduced to rubble, including City Hall, the new Post Office, the Parrot Building ( previously the largest department store in the West) , the Chronicle and Examiner Buildings ( San Francisco's two major newspapers) , and Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto.
In the wake of the destruction, urban planners immediately set to work to rebuild the shattered city. They did this with gusto, designing new buildings, pipes and streets with earthquake safety in mind. These ongoing precautions no doubt contributed to the phenomenal performance of the city's infrastructure during the earthquake of 1989, in which, although millions of dollars in damage occurred, widespread major destruction and loss of life were avoided.

1. In Paragraph 2, the phrase “...martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check“ means ______.
A：without martial law, the madness would have been uncontrollable
B：martial law was the only means by which the madness could be controlled
C：martial law was the method chosen to control the madness
D：martial law succeeded in controlling the situation
正确答案：A
答案为C，属于信息推断题。...martial law was imposed to keep the madness in check在 第2段最后一句，由上下文得知：地震发生时，全城居民处于极度恐慌之中。后来人们纷纷远离倒塌的摩天大楼，逃往公园中的安全地带，这是由于军管法强令控制了老百姓中的恐慌现象。由此可知，选项C正确。

2. The mentioning of the various buildings destroyed implies that ______ .
A：almost all aspects of importance in the city suffered as a result of the earthquake
B：the major functions of the city could no longer be performed after the earthquake
C：the most major damage from the earthquake came in the form of those buildings listed
D：the damage caused by the earthquake was specific, but hit the most important areas in the city
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推断题。第4段最后一句：此外，几乎城中的所有主要建筑物都变成一堆瓦砾，市政厅、新邮局、鹦鹉大厦、《纪事报》及《审查者》大厦以及帕洛阿尔托附近的斯坦福大学都在劫难逃。文章拿这些城市重要的基础建筑举例无非是想说明这次地震造成的影响之大。因此，选项A正确。

3. Paragraph 5 suggests that _______ .
A：due to the precautions put in place after the 1906 earthquake, San Francisco is now safe from future earthquakes
B：although damage will probably occur in the next big earthquake in San Francisco, the precautions put in place after 1906 will ensure that none of the damage is major
C：the result of the 1906 earthquake was positive, because it allowed city planners to build a newer, more beautiful and safer city
D：although the 1906 earthquake was tragic, a positive result emerged in the form of increased safety that has already yielded benefits
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。相关内容在第5段最后一句：毫无疑问，不间断地执行这些预防措施也是这座城市的基础设施在1989年地震期间能够保存完好的主要原因，在那场地震中，尽管没能避免数百万美元的损失，但是并未发生大面积的重大破坏以及人员伤亡。由此可知，选项D正确。

4. The author mentions the situation of firemen in Paragraph 3 in order to _______ .
A：demonstrate that even those best equipped to handle the situation were at a loss
B：show that the situation was utterly hopeless
C：explain why the fire crews were unable to contain the damage caused by fire
D：give one example of a group of people that the earthquake particularly hurt
正确答案：A
答案为A．属于信息推断题。题目中的关键词firemen出现在第3段第2句：英勇的消防员迅速赶到火灾现场，结果却发现中央供水管道也已经在地震中被毁坏，最后他们只能眼睁睁地看着火势肆虐，蔓延的范围越来越广。由此可推知，再勇敢的消防员即使配备先进的设备也会有无计可施的时候。因此，选项A正确。

5. The story of San Francisco’s reaction to the 1906 earthquake can best be described as ______ .
A：profound loss followed by stoic rebuilding
B：false confidence followed by a lesson learned
C：irretrievable loss followed by grief and mourning
D：a great city shattered and rebuilt, but never the same again
正确答案：A
答案为A，属于信息归纳题。题目问：下面哪个选项可以最恰当地描述1906年旧金山发生的地震？文章第1段是对这次地震的总体介绍；第2、3、4段描述了具体过程及所造成的损失；最后一段突出了旧金山城市重建工作的顺利展开及抗震决心。由此可知，选项A正确。

 Passage Three
  For several years, scientists have been testing a substance called interferon (干扰素), a potential wonder drug that is proving to be effective in treating a variety of ailments, including virus infections, bacteria infections, and tumors. To date, the new drug has provoked no negative reaction of sufficient significance to discourage its use. But in spite of its success, last year only one gram was produced in the entire world.
The reason for the scarcity lies in the structure of interferon. A species of specific protein, the interferon produced from one animal species cannot be used in treating another animal species.  In other words, to treat human beings, only interferon produced by human beings may be used. The drug is produced by infecting white blood cells with a virus. Fortunately, it is so powerful that the amount given each patient per injection is very small.
Unlike antibiotics, interferon does not attack germs directly. Instead, it makes unaffected cells resistant to infection, and prevents the multiplication of viruses within cells.
As you might conclude, one of the most dramatic uses of interferon has been in the treatment of cancer. Dr. Hans Strander, research physician at Sweden's famous Karolinska Institute, has treated more than one hundred cancer patients with the new drug. Among a group of selected patients who have undergone surgical procedures for advanced cancer, half were given interferon. The survival rate over a three-year period was 70 percent among those who were treated with interferon as compared with only 10 t030 percent among those who have received the conventional treatments.
In the United States, a large-scale project supported by the American Cancer Society is now underway. If the experiment is successful, interferon could become one of the greatest medical discoveries of our time.

1. In what does interferon differ from antibiotics?
A：Interferon has serious side effects, whereas antibiotics do not.
B：Interferon is available in large supply, whereas antibiotics are not
C：Antibiotics are very effective, while interferon is not.
D：Antibiotics kill germs by attacking them directly, while interferon does not.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文中第3段首句提及，与抗生素不同的是，干扰素不直 接攻击病菌。由此可知，答案为D。

2. What effect does interferon have on infection?
A：It provokes a negative reaction.
B：It keeps healthy cells from becoming infected.
C：It causes healthy cells to grow.
D：It attacks viruses.
正确答案：B
答案为B，属于事实细节题。文中第3段第2句提及，干扰素的作用是让未感染的细胞具有抗感染性。由此可知，答案为B。

3. Interferon is produced by _______ .
A：infecting viruses, bacteria, and tumors with a drug
B：infecting proteins with a virus
C：infecting white blood cells with a virus
D：infecting viruses with proteins
正确答案：C
答案为C，属于事实细节题。文中第2段倒数第2句提及，通过利用病毒感染白细胞产生该药物。由此可知，答案为C。

4. Interferon has not been widely used because it is ________ .
A：still very dangerous
B：being tested in the United States
C：difficult to produce in large quantities
D：not effective for human beings
正确答案：B
答案为B．属于信息推断题。文中最后一段提及该药在美国尚在试验之中，由此可推知，药品还没有大范围使用，故答案为B。

5. Which of the following is true of the results of Dr. Stander’s experiments?
A：Both interferon and conventional treatments should be used to ensure the survival of the patients.
B：At the end of three years, only ten to thirty percent of the patients who had not received interferon died.
C：Only the patients who received interferon survived.
D：Most of the patients who were treated with inferno survived.
正确答案：D
答案为D，属于信息推断题。文中第4段的末句提及使用干扰素的患者的存活率是70%，由此可知，使用干扰素治疗的大部分患者存活了，故答案为D。
